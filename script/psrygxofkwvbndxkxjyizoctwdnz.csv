<p><span>Our next talk is set and comes to us from Dave Johnson. He'll be talking about how <a href=""http://www.wayin.com/"">Wayin</a> does cloud orchestration and makes heavy use of Amazon's cloud infrastructure.</span></p>
<p>For this talk we'll be back at <a href=""http://argylesocial.com/"">Argyle Social</a> in downtown Durham. Pizza will be provided. A reminder that you can park in the deck at the end of Rigsbee Ave. and it will be free, since they stop collecting money so long as you leave after 7.</p>
<p>We're also inviting our friends from the Triangle AWS meetup to join us, since that group is run by Argyle Social and Dave's talk is going to focus a lot on Amazon's services.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing everyone at the talk.</p>
<p>- Mark</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>More details on the talk and on Dave's background:</span></p>
<p><span> <br />

Wayin offers products that organizations use to engage with their customers, constituents and fans via Twitter and other social networks. These products are web-based, designed to serve large numbers of users and to handle large spikes in traffic associated with sports, entertainment, conferences and other events.  <br />

 Dave's talk will cover cloud orchestration, cloud orchestration benefits in general and the specifics of how Wayin uses cloud orchestration to run the Wayin Hub, a Twitter micro-site assembly service. He'll explain how Wayin designs software, sets-up AWS infrastructure, deploys applications and scales-up and down to meet changing workloads automatically via Amazon's Cloud Formation orchestration service. The talk will cover a wide-range of AWS services including EC2, EBS, Route53, S3, SQS, CloudWatch and more.</span></p>

541,Breaking Free of Your Growth Constraints- Entrepreneur Workshop,"In a March 2013 Forbes Magazine article it was stated that 9 out of 10 startups go out of business. There are many diverse reasons why good people with good ideas don’t translate into good businesses. The Accelerence management team has worked diligently over the last 25 years to distill these many reasons into 7 primary growth and success constraints. In the seminar we will introduce the constraints as well as the strategies and tactics that break you free from them. There will be particular emphasis on building out a world class selling capability. 

Recognizing the intrinsic challenge of the entrepreneur – achieving growth and breaking the barriers of scale with limited resources – we designed the session to provide actionable insight on those very issues.  The seminar will discuss the most common constraints to successfully building a business as well as strategies and tactics to break free from those constraints.  At this workshop attendees will:
•	Use Accelerence diagnostics to identify your specific growth challenges
•	Delve into a well-honed model for building businesses that scale
•	Learn how to build out a world class selling capability

Sarah Kahn, UX Designer at Adzerk, recommended this book after reading it and will be leading the group discussion.</p>
<p>We are planning this event very far in advance to give you all a chance to read this book and gather your thoughts before discussin. Here are a few places where you can either check-out or purchase a copy of the book! (NOTE: This book is not available in any of the Orange County Libraries.)</p>

<p>Here is a synopsis taken from Amazon.com on the book:</p>
<p style=""padding-left : 30px""><em>In their groundbreaking book, <strong>Women Don’t Ask</strong>, Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever uncovered a startling fact: even women who negotiate brilliantly on behalf of others often falter when it comes to asking for themselves. Now they’ve developed the action plan that women all over the country requested—a guide to negotiation that starts before you get to the bargaining table.</em> <br />

 <br />

 <em><strong>Ask for It</strong> explains why it’s essential to ask (men do it all the time) and teaches you how to ask effectively, in ways that feel comfortable to you as a woman. Whether you currently avoid negotiating like the plague or consider yourself hard-charging and fearless, Babcock and Laschever’s compelling stories of real women will help you recognize how much more you deserve—whether it’s a raise, that overdue promotion, an exciting new assignment, or even extra help around the house. Their four-phase program, backed by years of research, will show you how to identify what you’re really worth, maximize your bargaining power, develop the best strategy for your situation, and manage the reactions and emotions that may arise—on both sides. Guided step-by-step, you’ll learn how to draw on the special strengths you bring to the negotiating table to reach agreements that benefit everyone involved.</em> <br />

 <br />

 <em>This collaborative, problem-solving approach will propel you to new places both professionally and personally—and open doors you thought were closed. Because if you never hear no, you’re not asking enough.</em> <span style=""font-size : small""> <br />

Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>Ground rules:<br/>1. No force.<br/>2. No fraud.<br/>3. No coercion.<br/>4.

As a preprocessor aficionado nary a day goes by without him evangelizing Sass, Haml or CoffeeScript. In his presentation, you'll learn how advancements in CSS have quickly shifted the conversation from what you can do to what you shouldn't do. This discussion goes into profiling CSS paint times and frame rates, optimizing selectors, the various implications of retina-friendly images, and common performance pitfalls in stylesheets.</p>

Allman.  I have lived in Raleigh, NC for over 17 years.  I have a Bachelor degree in Information Technology from University of Phoenix and an Associate degree in Computer Information Technology from Mott Community college in Flint, MI.  I am currently employed with Allscripts as software developer and Scrum Master for my agile team.  I have worked in an agile environment for almost 4 years and in software development for over 16 years.  I became a Certified Scrum Master almost 2 years ago and began leading my team part time as Scrum Master.  I passed the Certified Scrum Professional certification in December, 2012.</span> <span>I enjoy working in an agile environment because as an individual I can work on different tasks, not just development.</span> <span>As a team, we have the ability to change our work process for the better which improves our daily work life.</span> <span>I enjoy hiking, yoga, swimming, camping, arts and crafts, and spending time with my daughter, family and friends.</span> <span>I also love to travel to different places, spending time at the beach and in the mountains.</span></p>",2013-10-01,2013-06-13 02:49:09.016472,2013-06-13 02:49:09.016472,http://www.meetup.com/agileRTP/events/119260152/,Agile RTP (ARTp),,

67,Tall Tall Trees / Prypyat,"<P><H4>TALL TALL TREES</H4><BR>Mike Savino is not your grandaddy's banjo player, and Tall Tall Trees is definitely not your average indie-folk outfit from NYC. Savino has released two records on his own start-up label Good Neighbor Records, Tall Tall Trees (2009), and moment (2012), and has toured extensively, mystifying audiences with his innovative banjo technique. Whether performing with a full band or solo, Savino runs his instrument, dubbed by fans as the ""space banjo"" or ""banjotron"", through a slab of effects and loopers, bowing, drumming, and strumming out multi-textured arrangements on the fly to support his lyrically driven songs. Most recently, Tall Tall Trees has been touring the US and Canada collaborating with beatboxing violinist, and of Montreal alum, Kishi Bashi. Savino is currently working on a third record which he is expecting to release in 2014.</P>
<P><I><B>""Bearded man sings songs, violates banjo"" - CMJ</B></I></P>
<P>Moment, the band's sophomore album, was recorded with a full band including Mathias Kunzli (drums, percussion), Kyle Sanna (guitar, keyboards), Benjamin Campbell (bass), and Dave Gilbert (guitar) and was made possible by a highly successful Kickstarter campaign. The album has been called ""an LP of majestic sonic qualities"" by Groopease and showcases their evolution from a quirky bluegrass-leaning side project into a fully formed indie-rock band. Recorded by Matthew Cullen (My Morning Jacket, Ray LaMontagne) at Dreamland Studios (Fleet Foxes, Delta Spirit) outside of Woodstock, NY, and mixed by Bill Moriarty (Dr. Dog, Man Man), moment finds the band crafting a rich textured sound to support the more complex themes dealt with in this set of nine songs.  Inspired by a group camping trip into the Alaskan wilderness, moment tells the story of a man yearning for escape and connection with nature. Listen Before You Buy called it a ""beautiful and compelling album"", drawing references to Wilco and Brian Eno.</P>
<P>Tall Tall Trees' self-titled debut was released in 2009. Jezebel Music dubbed it ""a perfect storm of catchy songwriting, spot on performances, and crisp, inventive production."" The record became a mainstay on college radio charts for several months despite the band's lack of promotional funding. According to College Music Journal , ""it's impossible not to smile at their pop-driven folk songs"" earning the band official showcases at the CMJ Music Marathon three years in a row.</P>
<P>Songs like ""Heart Says Go"" and ""Bubble Gum"" have found their way onto television shows like Teen Mom, American Pickers, and Two and a Half Men and have earned the band a loyal cult following for their eclectic brand on indie folk-rock.</P>

<P><H4>PRYPYAT</H4><BR>Prypyat is the holy combination of Duncan Webster (Hammer No More the Fingers) and Leah Gibson (Lost in the Trees). Their music combines unforgettable melodies refined from Duncan's rock n' roll youth with the sweet dark-chocolately sounds of the cello to which Leah dedicated her classical music studies. Coming from what seems to be two divergent musical projects - the skilled pop rock of 'Hammer No More the Fingers' and the orchestral folk of 'Lost in the Trees' - the two create a full and refreshing sound - rich, absorbing melodies floating over the rhythmic fingerpicking of Duncan Webster. A little sun-shiney, a little moon-lighty, sometimes nostalgic, sometimes quirky, with a hint of darkness, Prypyat will make you feel like you've been swept up by a cloud and dropped off into some enchanted night-meadow.</P>

<p>No prior experience is required to attend hack afternoon and you don't even need to own an Arduino. There are plenty of members who will be glad to let you look over their shoulder and ask questions. Some will even hand you some parts and let you tinker. If you have your own parts, definitely bring them. We have lots of space and everyone should have room to work on a reasonably sized project.</p>
<p>You don't need to be a member of SplatSpace in order to attend, but please do ask about the membership options while you're there. It's a great group of folks and, if you're into Ard <br />

 uino, there's a good chance that you'll share interests with many of our members.</p>
<p>Go here for directions to SplatSpace: <a href=""http://splatspace.org"" target=""_blank"">http://splatspace.org/location/</a>...</p>
<p>If anyone has projects they'd like to collaborate on, feel free to start a conversation on the trianglearduino@googlegroups.com mailing list. This announcement has also been cross-posted to that list.</p>
<p>We hope to see you there!</p>",2013-06-22,2013-06-16 22:49:36.245196,2013-06-16 22:49:36.245196,http://www.meetup.com/splatspace/events/121232042/,Splat Space - Durham's Hackerspace,,

107,"Big Data Analysis Patterns with Hadoop, Mahout and SOLR","<p><strong><span>Big Data Analysis Patterns</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Speaker:</span> <span>Brad Anderson, MapR</span></p>
<p><span>Date: June 27th, 6:30PM</span></p>
<p><span>Location: Bronto Software, Durham, NC</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Big Data Analysis Patterns: Tying real world use cases to strategies for analysis using big data technologies and tools.</p>
<p><span>Big data is ushering in a new era for analytics with large scale data and relatively simple algorithms driving results rather than relying on complex models that use sample data. When you are ready to extract benefits from your data, how do you decide what approach, what algorithm, what tool to use? The answer is simpler than you think.</span></p>
<p><span>This session tackles big data analysis with a practical description of strategies for several classes of application types, identified concretely with use cases. Topics include new approaches to search and recommendation using scalable technologies such as Hadoop, Mahout, Storm, Solr, &amp; Titan.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>About the Speaker</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Brad Anderson has been wrangling data for 20 years, first with enterprise data warehouses and more recently building and using non-relational big data tools. Previously, he worked on a large-scale video-on-demand platform in Erlang, helped Cloudant build its hosted NoSQL offering based on CouchDB, and organized the NoSQL East 2009 conference in Atlanta. He has recently worked with Cascading, Storm and Neo4J, and has contributed code to the HBase open-source project. Brad has founded or co-founded four technology companies, and his first company operates today as Mirus Restaurant Solutions.</span></p>",2013-06-27,2013-06-21 09:00:23.020882,2013-06-21 09:00:23.020882,http://www.meetup.com/TriHUG/events/125585432/,Triangle Hadoop Users Group,,
108,Main Meeting: Don't Design Like a Programmer,"<p><span>Have you ever wondered why UI design is so hard? The top challenge is to think about UI design the right way.</span></p>
<p><span>In this talk, Everett McKay (a programmer!) explains the UI design approach often used by programmers, exactly why such designs fail with users, and presents some practical techniques that programmers can use to design in a truly user-centered way. <br />

</span></p>
<p><span>Presentor</span><span>: <strong>Everett McKay</strong> is Principal of UX Design Edge, a user experience design training and consulting company for mobile, web, and desktop applications based in Vermont. Everett's specialty is UX design training for software professionals who aren't experienced designers through onsite and public courses and workshops. He just finished writing UI is Communication: How to Design Intuitive, User Centered Interfaces by Focusing on Effective Communication to be published by Morgan Kaufmann in June.</span></p>
<p><span>Previously, Everett was a Senior Program Manager at Microsoft Corporation on the Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows Server teams. While there, he was responsible for the writing of and consulting on the Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines, and was also responsible for teaching their in-house introductory UI design course. Before joining Microsoft, Everett was a programmer, specializing in designing and developing Windows and Macintosh user interfaces.</span></p>
<p><strong>**Special Note:**</strong> <br />

 <span><span>Everett is offering his UX Design Essentials course at RTP on July 8 – 10. Mention that you are a Triangle .NET User Group member for a 15% discount: <a href=""http://uxdesignessentialsnc.eventbrite.com/"">http://uxdesignessentialsnc.eventbrite.com/ <br />

110,Maintaining Sanity,"<p>Nathaniel stumbled into being a maintainer on a big open source project pretty much by accident; he was contributing patches a lot and didn't want to be a nuisance, so he asked for commit privileges. At first he was just expediting his own patches, but then there were all these outstanding issues, and before he knew it he was a top committer on the project.</p>
<p>Being a maintainer is fun, but it can also be annoying and exhausting. Nathaniel will talk about the things that he’s struggled with as a maintainer and the workflow he’s developed over time to keep himself sane. There will be Git tips gleaned from kernel maintainers, ideas on encouraging contributions without feeling the need to accept every patch, straight talk on avoiding burnout, and most importantly Nathaniel will try to get across the joy that comes from being instrumental in moving a useful piece of software forward.</p>
<p>Not an open source maintainer and have no plans to ever be one? You should still come, since everything Nathaniel will talk about will also help you be a better open source contributor as well!</p>
<p>Nathaniel enjoys making things go at Spreedly, tickling his six kids, and taking long walks in the mountains with his wife. He is the original author of Test::Unit and is a current maintainer of Active Merchant. If you want to know more than that, the NSA apparently knows all about him.</p>",2013-07-09,2013-06-22 09:00:19.274509,2013-06-22 09:00:19.274509,http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/events/125778522/,The Triangle Ruby Brigade (Triangle.rb),,

821,Main Meeting: Using C#’s Async Effectively - Reed Copsey,"<p>Visual Studio 2012 and 2013 brought many new features, but few as exciting as the new language support for asynchrony in C# and VB.Net. While the new async and await keywords provide huge benefits when writing asynchronous code, they also bring potential danger. Async introduces new opportunities for confusion, incredibly messy abstractions, and the types of subtle bugs that cause nightmares to developers everywhere.<br/>This talk will focus on how to think about asynchrony in general, when to use async, specific pitfalls arising from async and await, and some general guidelines to follow when creating asynchronous libraries and composing asynchrony in your own code.</p> <p>Speaker: <b>Reed Copsey, Jr.</b><br/>Reed Copsey, Jr. creates scientific software. He is the CTO of C Tech Development Corporation, a company developing 3D software for the Earth Sciences.

Since code written in Dart can be converted to Javascript, your Dart can still run on any modern browser.</p>
<p><span>This class will give an introduction to the Dart programming language, libraries, and tools. You'll build a simple application in Dart and learn about the advanced features provided by the platform.</span></p>
<p><span>Attendees should be familiar with HTML and some basic Javascript. Experience with object oriented programming (C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc.) is also helpful.</span></p>

127,Main Meeting: An Introduction to F# for the C# Developer - Mathias Brandewinder,"<p> <br />

 An Introduction to F# for the C# Developer</p>
<p>Back in 2010, Visual Studio shipped with a new language on board: F#. Out of curiosity, I started playing with it, and got hooked. F# is a fantastic language - it mixes functional and Object Oriented approaches seamlessly, encourages writing bug-free code (it is virtually impossible to get a null exception...), comes with great features, and is incredibly productive. For the C# developer accustomed to Object Oriented thinking, it can also be a bit daunting at first.</p>
<p>Mathias Brandewinder has been writing software in C# for nearly 10 years, and loving every minute of it, except maybe for a few release days. He is an F# MVP, enjoys arguing about code and how to make it better, and gets very excited when discussing TDD or F#. His other professional interests are applied math and probability. If you want to know more about him, you can check out his blog at www.clear-lines.com/blog or find him on Twitter as @brandewinder.</p>

Yet like a good conference, it's often not the talks that you go for but the hallway track. This month it's entirely about the hallway track. We're hosting a drinkup at <a href=""http://www.fullsteam.ag/"">Fullsteam</a> in Durham, on Tuesday, July 16.</p>
<p>Please note the change in date. At the request of Fullsteam we're meeting on Tuesday instead of Wednesday as they have a run club that meets on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>Also, why stop at just our group? Invitations for the drinkup have been extended to Triangle.rb as well so we can have more people out discussing the latest happenings in technology and the Triangle.</p>
<p>The event officially starts at 7pm. Please come find me at the event (I'll wear my Opscode shirt that night) and ask me for the password to the bar tab. That's right, Opscode and Adzerk are sponsoring a round or two of drinks (until we hit the limit of the money they've graciously provided). We ask that you please drink responsibly and not abuse this so that we can continue this in the future.</p>
<p>Please RSVP for this event so we can have a rough count of how many people will be present so Fullsteam can ensure they have enough bartenders on site to handle the crowd.</p>
<p>Dinner is not provided this time, however the <a href=""http://americanmeltdown.org/"">American Meltdown food truck</a> is scheduled to be onsite that night if you want to purchase something.</p>

161,Distributed Clojure with Matt Hoffman,"<p>Matt will give a talk and Relevance will provide pizza and beverages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Distributed Clojure</p>
<p>So you have a Clojure project, and you want to expand beyond one JVM.  What are your options? When do you pick Cascalog, vs. Storm, vs. vanilla Hadoop, vs. a simple queue? We'll give an overview of options for distributed processing in the Clojure universe, as well as some pros and cons of each. If you're awash in options for scaling your project, this will hopefully be helpful for you. If you're using one of these options and want to offer your experience or get a feel for what else is out there, this will hopefully be helpful for you. If you just want to have pizza and imagine parenthesis flying over network cables, this will hopefully be somewhat entertaining.Bring your own experience:  We'll cover typical use cases and ""you might want to use this when ..."" scenarios for some of the big and not-so-big players in the distributed processing world, but think of it as more of a guided discussion rather than pure presentation. Your experience and anecdotes are welcome! <br />

199,Dev Craftsmanship sig: jumpstarting new projects - All,"<p>This is the first of a series of sessions that will help developers grease the skids for developing small personal projects (or demos for presentations) very quickly.</p>
<p>We'll try to build a simple but sound architecture that can be reused to build a basic website quickly.</p>
<p>To get the ball rolling, here’s a few things we're likely to cover: <br />

- setting up git hub <br />

- determining target audience (desktop, web, tablet, phones)(proprietary vs. html5/css3) <br />

- determining framework (mvc, web forms,win8, etc ) <br />

- choosing a template in VS <br />

- what extra addins/utilities (bootstrap, knockout, handlebars vs jsRender,jsViews,jsObservable,jquery Templates, jquery, backbone, datatables vs. jqgrid, etc) <br />

See what others think. Don't worry about someone stealing your idea - ideas are dime a dozen and you will anyway have to present your idea to large audiences to take it to next level.</p>

205,Taming Your CSS with Sass,"<p><span>Today's CSS is more powerful than ever. Unfortunately we've paid the price for that power with increased complexity. It doesn't take much now for a project's stylesheet to spiral out of control. This is the primary reason why the web development community has turned to CSS preprocessors for help. While preprocessors don't make CSS more powerful, they do make it much more maintainable and easier to write. There are a variety of preprocessor choices out there, but Sass is one of the more powerful and actively developed choices.</span></p>
<p>In this workshop you are going to get up and running with Sass and learn about it's powerful feature set. In the end you'll be familiar with:</p>
<ul>
<li>What it means to compile your CSS</li>
<li>How to organize a Sass project</li>
<li>How to work with features like variables, nesting, extending and functions</li>
<li>How to use mixins and write your own</li>
<li>Simplifying media queries with content blocks</li>
<li>Working with Sass libraries like Compass and Bourbon</li>
<li>Understanding Sass's conditional logic</li>
</ul>
<p>After this workshop you'll be able to write organized, maintainable and modular stylesheets. You'll be able to tame CSS3 vendor prefixes and make global changes to your project by just changing a couple lines of code. The best part of all there is no crazy syntax to learn, it's still the CSS you know and love but with all the awesome benefits of a programming language.</p>
<p>This will be a two session class:</p>

214,Triangle Buttonwood - P2P Cryptocurrency Trading,"<p>In an attempt to garner support for a Triangle Buttonwood peer-to-peer exchange, I welcome anyone interested in exchanging (or discussing) cryptocurrencies to join us at Nash Square on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are math-based currencies which aren't controlled by any central entity, but instead by a distributed computer network which secures the payment network against fraud. The first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which will likely be the dominant cryptocurrency being traded at each meetup (though all cryptocurrencies are welcome). Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Ground rules: <br />

 1. No force. <br />

 2. No fraud. <br />

 3. No coercion. <br />

 4. Have fun!</p>",2013-08-01,2013-07-28 09:00:24.589386,2013-07-28 09:00:24.589386,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/131687722/,Triangle Bitcoin Meetup,,

 <br />

 One of the valid complaints about DevOps is that it’s difficult to describe what it is.  Currently, DevOps is more like a philosophical movement, and not yet a precise collection of practices, descriptive or prescriptive (e.g., CMM-I, ITIL, Agile, etc.).  At this early stage we’re in, DevOps is more like a vibrant community of practitioners who are interesting in replicating the performance outcomes and culture as exemplified in the seminal John Allspaw/Tim Hammond 2009 Velocity presentation about doing “ten deploys a day” at Flickr.</p>
<p>The intent behind the “DevOps Cookbook” project is to catalog what the “high performing DevOps organizations” all have in common, and then provide prescriptive guidance so that other organizations can replicate their results.  Very much like the “Visible Ops Handbook,” we are attempting to describe all the necessary and sufficient steps to create the culture, values, processes, procedures and daily work behind their transformations.</p>
<p>We describe what is required from each of the major stakeholders, including Development, Test, Product Management, as well as IT Operations.  We will present the common constraints and conditions that apply each of the patterns, as well as the modifications that must be done to existing patterns.  Examples include Dev patterns (e.g., Agile and continuous integration and release processes) and IT Operations patterns (e.g., release, change, incident and problem management, monitoring, escalation, escalation of preventive project work, etc.).</p>
<p>By doing this, we hope to significantly increase the probability of DevOps initiatives succeeding, accelerate its adoption curve, and ideally, lower the activation energy required for DevOps transformations to start and finish.</p>
<p>This research is the continuation of the Patrick DeBois’ pioneering work in the DevOps community, as well as John Willis and Gene Kim’s decades long passion for studying and creating high performing IT organizations.</p>

<P STYLE=""color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">In 2012, a CNN poll showed that 60% of persons questioned reported having a family member or close friend who identified with being gay or lesbian. Attitudes towards homosexuality are changing. Yet, despite changing attitudes, state laws have failed to follow suit.</P>
<P STYLE=""color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">The documentary film, Unconditional, aims to raise awareness of the ways that current North Carolina laws harm the children and parents in same-sex families. While there are many films being made on gay rights, Unconditional is unique for several reasons.</P>
<P STYLE=""color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">First, the film focuses on a smaller issue within the larger issue of gay rights. We are focusing on parental rights, specifically the state’s second-parent adoption statute. A second-parent adoption in North Carolina would allow the non-biological parent to obtain legal ties to their children without the biological parent giving up his or her legal rights.</P>
<P STYLE=""color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">Second, we have unique access to key figures in the North Carolina movement to secure rights for same-sex parents. Our film’s characters, Sara and Julie, were the first couple in North Carolina to obtain a second-parent adoption in 2004. The film will show what they went through to get the adoption and will follow what they are doing to secure legal ties to their children after the North Carolina Supreme Court overturned second-parent adoptions in 2010.</P>
<P STYLE=""color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"">The story of our other character in the film, “Catherine”, illustrates a very real, and worst-case scenario for same-sex parents. When Catherine’s partner moved out, she took their kids with her. ”Catherine” had no rights to see her children because she was not considered a legal parent. We will learn of her struggle to see her kids again.</P>

<p>This session will be organized as an interactive workshop. Come over, and learn yourself a Machine Learning and F# for great good! No prior experience with Machine Learning required, and F# beginners are very welcome - it will be a great opportunity to see F# in action, and why it's awesome.</p>
<p>To get the most from the session please try and bring a laptop along with F# installed (ideally either MonoDevelop or Visual Studio Web Express/Full Edition).</p>
<p> <br />

 Bio</p>
<p>Mathias Brandewinder has been writing software in C# for 7+ years, and loving every minute of it, except maybe for a few release days. He is an F# MVP, enjoys arguing about code and how to make it better, and gets very excited when discussing TDD or F#. His other professional interests are applied math and probability. If you want to know more about him, you can check out his blog at www.clear-lines.com/blog or find him on Twitter as @brandewinder.</p>",2013-08-15,2013-08-04 17:58:41.092407,2013-08-04 17:58:41.092407,http://www.meetup.com/TriNUG/events/130852172/,Triangle .NET User Group,,

<p><span>""Developed from a course titled ""Human-Computer Interaction"" that he taught at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, Dr. Jeff Johnson -- who holds degrees from Yale and Stanford, experience at Xerox and author of the book, ""GUI Bloopers"" -- offers contextual explanations as to how we visualize and categorize information, data and images in such a manner that engineers and programmers can design user interfaces in the most effective manner. It's a well-written, insightful and very practical guide that will be of interest to anyone interested in the how-and-why of computer/machine interface design.</span> <br />

 <br />

 <span>Topics covered include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>How our visual perceptions are biased by experience, the current context, and user's intentions/goals;</span></li>
<li><span>How our vision is optimized to see structure; Gestalt principles of proximity, continuity, closure, symmetry, figure/ground separation and then how they are combined;</span></li>
<li><span>How structure enhances people's ability to scan long numbers; how visual hierarchy enables readers to focus on the most relevant information;</span></li>
<li><span>A discussion of psychological theory that indicates than we're ""wired for language, but not for reading"" and the design implications of these findings;</span></li>
<li><span>Limitations of our color vision and implications for how color is presented in user interfaces; the fact that user's peripheral vision is poor and common methods used to makes messages more visible (e.g. pop-ups, sound, and flash/motion);</span></li>
<li><span>Design implications regarding our limited short term and long term memory; how recognition and learning from experience for readers is typically easy while problem solving and recall is hard;</span></li>
<li><span>And, a discussion of time requirements for systems designers to consider.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Written in an easy-to-understand narrative, lecture-format with dozens of illustrations in each chapter, readers will find this book to be a delightful and welcome primer detailing the fundamental psychological principles behind effective design rules.""</span></p>

257,Motivation through Innovation,"<p><strong><span>Motivation through Innovation</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>As agile team members, we struggle with engaging and motivating our teams and our organizations. Agile methodologies talk about self-empowerment, but few talk about building a culture of innovation. Such a culture infuses not just the development teams, but every aspect of an organization. It is this culture that makes coming into work each day less like work. In this talk, I draw from Dan Pink and discuss what motivates individuals, and show how to translate that knowledge into what can motivate organizations.</span></span></p>

261,Real-time data analysis with Storm and Beacon,"<p>Title: Real-time data analysis with Storm and Beacon</p>
<p>Speaker: Nick Poore, IBM Emerging Technologies, jStart Team</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Storm and IBM's jStart Beacon - Storm is an open source distributed realtime computation system. Storm allows a developer to easily build scalable and  fault-tolerant applications that will process streaming data from multiple data sources. Storm does processing in realtime what Hadoop does in batch process.  jStart Beacon is web based application designed for line of business users that need to build Storm applications without writing code.  Beacon uses a drag and drop UI look and feel to allow a user to design their application from their data inputs and have these big data apps up and running in minutes. 

In this talk we will go over some of what Storm does and its similarities/differences to Hadoop and we will also discuss how IBM is using Storm to delivery big data analytics applications built by line of business users.

More info about jStart Beacon can be found at: www.ibm.com/beacon</p>

269,Green Gallery Exhibit:  Remix Redux,"<P><SPAN STYLE=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Expand your vision of creative reuse by exploring the world of electronic and audio/visual reuse in the next Green Gallery show at The Scrap Exchange! </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Remix Redux, on display July 19 – August 10, is an art exhibit that combines interactive media stations inviting viewer participation, together with online content curated to explore how artists and the public have been reusing, replaying, remixing and reinventing electronic media throughout history. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Media stations within the gallery will include vintage and retro audio/visual equipment such as a record turn table, slide projector, multi-channel audio mixer, overhead projector, and other equipment that viewers can interact with on some level. For example, one of the stations will include a cassette tape player and dozens of vintage cassette mix tapes culled from a massive collection that has been accumulated by The Scrap Exchange. (Mix tapes provide a retro example in this exhibit of the freedom seized by the public to take the existing technology of the day and use it to create their own personal playlists.) Viewers can pick and choose mix tapes to play in the tape deck, constantly changing out background music within the exhibit based on viewer choice at any moment in time. Additional media stations will provide other interactive audio/visual experiences. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">The viewer will also be able to access in-depth content about audio/visual reuse via QR codes artfully displayed throughout the exhibit. The QR codes will link to articles, interviews, videos and websites across the internet that provide information about electronic media reuse. The content within these links will include discussions of sampling in the hip hop music industry, copyright battles, examples of reuse in the film industry, manipulation of electronic and digital media to create new art forms, and more. </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Remix Redux is being produced and installed by the Green Gallery committee, a group of artists responsible for the year-round exhibit schedule and programming for the gallery. Daniel Bagnell, an artist on the committee and the Design Manager at The Scrap Exchange, explains the concept behind this exhibit. “What is “creative reuse”? The idea is open to many interpretations. A collage is creative reuse. A junk sculpture or a quilt made from scraps is creative reuse. But how far can we stretch this idea? Is music made with samples creative reuse? Is DJing creative reuse? Is circuit bending creative reuse? We think so and we know there are myriad art forms that are in some way related to the concept of creative reuse.” </SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"">Remix Redux runs July 19 through August 10. An opening reception is scheduled on July 19 from 6-9pm that includes refreshments, free art-making and music by DJ Sean Thegan. Green Gallery receptions are free, open to the public and sponsored by PBR. The Green Gallery is open 7 days per week during regular Scrap Exchange store hours.

In this opening session of the HTML5/CSS3 series, you will learn exactly what HTML5 is and while there are new semantic markup features, you will learn that HTML5 encompasses more than markup. HTML5's new JavaScript APIs introduce a wide variety of new capabilities including geolocation, local storage, drawing with the canvas, video &amp; audio playback and more. Any discussion of web/mobile technologies would be woefully inadequate without a review of some of the new features in CSS3 like animation, drop shadows, rounded corners and media queries.

<p>It doesn't have to be Adobe-related, really complicated, or take up more than 1-2 minutes. It could be cool things you can do with a text editor, a web app, an iPhone/Android app you couldn't live without, some time-saving trick in Excel or Word, etc.</p>
<p>(Maybe what you know seems small or unimpressive to you or you think that no one else could possibly have any use for that one trick you came up with. But you're probably wrong. That one app/technique/trick/whatever you know could be the answer to making someone's life better.

824,Salary Negotiations Workshop,"<p>One of the most difficult aspects of getting or having a job is making sure you are being paid what you are worth.  All too often women (and men too) do not know how to determine their worth or how to ask for adequate compensation.  More importantly, they do not know the negotiation techniques that will create a result beneficial to all parties - you and your employer.</p> <p>This workshop will give introduce you to a few tools and tips on evaluating the value of a position, as well as, how to negotiate yourself into your dream job at the right salary. We will cover basic negotiation tactics, the questions to ask, the questions to be prepared for and how to respond to them.  With a combination of discussion, question and answer and role playing, this workshop will help you sharpen your negotiation skills and prepare you to effectively negotiate your salary for your next job offer or salary review.</p> <p><b>About Your Instructor</b></p> <p>Nicki Hollerman is a Technology Recruiter at Matrix Resources. </p>",2014-01-14,2013-12-28 09:04:37.929655,2013-12-28 09:04:37.929655,http://www.meetup.com/Girl-Develop-It-RDU/events/154687052/,Girl Develop It RDU,,

300,NSCoder Night - Raleigh - Weekly Hack Night,"<p><span>Per the comments below: Cafe Carolina is in the Arboretum Shopping Center at Harrison and Weston Parkway (take exit 287 off I-40)</span></p>
<p>(Thanks Keefe!)</p>
<p><span> <br />

</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span style=""font-size : small"">This is a completely open, free-form, ""just show up with a laptop (or a friend with a laptop) and hack on some Cocoa"" meeting. There's no agenda, and there's sure to be a great mix of coding and shooting the breeze about all things geeky. <em>(Hack night description blatantly stolen from Raleigh.rb's Ruby Hack Night)</em></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size : small"">See you there!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style=""font-size : small"">NSCoder Night is a weekly event where Cocoa developers come together for some coding and camaraderie in the relaxed atmosphere of a coffee shop or pub with a wireless network. Rumor has it that in the before-time, in the long-long-ago, it was once referred to as Tuesday night.</span></span></p>

301,Responsively Apart! The Raleigh-Durham Web Design Group Monthly Meetup,"<p><span>I'm happy to say that consummate professional Pepper Oldziey will be joining us tonight to reveal outstanding knowledge about responsive design and multi-device Web Design, acquired while attending An Event Apart in Washington D.C. last week.</span></p>
<p>If you are familiar with A List Apart and names like Eric Meyer and Jeffrey Zeldman, you may have a hint at the kind of quality of information Pepper has to share.</p>
<p>Come join us Tuesday night. Pepper's excitement about <span>the future of Web Design is sure to rub off!</span></p>
<p>- Mitch</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note About Meeting Times</strong></p>
<p>Since many of us get to the meeting early, we will make a half-hour available as a meet-eat-and-greet time prior to any presentations or shop talk. We will continue to start formally at 7:30pm, but the time change is to reflect this chatting time.</p>
<p>Since we all usually chat as people arrive, we will not continue to do a round-robin greeting at 7:30pm. We will instead end the greeting period with announcements, and then give the floor to the presenter or moderator.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr></hr>
<p> </p>
<p>Please consider the benefits of moderating, presenting lecture style, or giving a tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced Credibility</li>
<li>Visibility For Your Business</li>
<li>Increased Good Will</li>
</ul>
<p> <br />

 (Tentative speakers, THANK YOU for your participation.) <br />

<p>And don't forget Robert's generosity in donating the space to us for this time.</p>
<p>If you enjoy this event, and like the idea of coworking, you can help Robert and others fostering businesses like this by (1) spreading the word to others who may find such a format helpful, and/or (2) spending a day when we're not there as a group at Bull City Coworking and paying for a day pass. Pay it forward, and keep things like this accessible!</p>
<p>We'll work on our own projects most of the day - go out to lunch together (for those interested), and keep our eyes and ears open for opportunities to collaborate and help each other out.</p>
<p>Join us - even for just an hour or two!</p>",2013-08-23,2013-08-15 09:00:29.794332,2013-08-15 09:00:29.794332,http://www.meetup.com/triDUG/events/125032472/,Triangle Drupal Users' Group,,

<strong>Note About Meeting Times</strong></p>
<p>Since many of us get to the meeting early, we will make a half-hour available as a meet-eat-and-greet time prior to any presentations or shop talk. We will continue to start formally at 7:30pm, but the time change is to reflect this chatting time.</p>
<p>Since we all usually chat as people arrive, we will not continue to do a round-robin greeting at 7:30pm. We will instead end the greeting period with announcements, and then give the floor to the presenter or moderator.</p>

In doing so, you'll see how simple it is to get a Rack application up and running.</p>
<p>He'll then look at a number of real-world examples of how Rack and Rack Middleware can be used to elegantly solve problems, speed up your applications, improve your development environment, and clean up your application code.</p>

The first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which will likely be the dominant cryptocurrency being traded at each meetup (though all cryptocurrencies are welcome). Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p>

 1. No force. <br />

 2. No fraud. <br />

 3. No coercion. <br />

 4. Have fun!</p>",2013-08-22,2013-08-20 09:00:30.531251,2013-08-20 09:00:30.531251,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/135154172/,Triangle Bitcoin Meetup,,

 Dan + Melissa</span></p>
<p><span> <br />

</span></p>
<p><span>Jasmine is a testing framework for JavaScript based on Ruby's Rspec that makes writing tests for your code a pure joy.  I'll start by talking about how Jasmine works, how to make it work for you, and why it's so awesome with examples.  If there is enough interest and time, I'll then talk about how we develop, test and deploy at Etsy.</span></p>

369,"Durham Discussion of ""Designing with the Mind in Mind""","<p><span>Let's get together early September in Durham at Epocrates to discuss</span> Jeff Johnson's ""Designing with the Mind in Mind."" We'll geek out over the cognitive ""why"" behind design rules and discuss the always-fascinating topic of how visual design can affect our perceptions and behaviors.</p>
<p>You can buy the book here: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X"">http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X</a></p>

 <img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/4/0/event_260939712.jpeg"" style=""max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : right""></img></p>
<p><span>""Developed from a course titled ""Human-Computer Interaction"" that he taught at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, Dr. Jeff Johnson -- who holds degrees from Yale and Stanford, experience at Xerox and author of the book, ""GUI Bloopers"" -- offers contextual explanations as to how we visualize and categorize information, data and images in such a manner that engineers and programmers can design user interfaces in the most effective manner. It's a well-written, insightful and very practical guide that will be of interest to anyone interested in the how-and-why of computer/machine interface design.</span> <br />

 <br />

 <span>Topics covered include:</span></p>
<p><span>How our visual perceptions are biased by experience, the current context, and user's intentions/goals;</span></p>
<p><span>How our vision is optimized to see structure; Gestalt principles of proximity, continuity, closure, symmetry, figure/ground separation and then how they are combined;</span></p>
<p><span>How structure enhances people's ability to scan long numbers; how visual hierarchy enables readers to focus on the most relevant information;</span></p>
<p><span>A discussion of psychological theory that indicates than we're ""wired for language, but not for reading"" and the design implications of these findings;</span></p>
<p><span>Limitations of our color vision and implications for how color is presented in user interfaces; the fact that user's peripheral vision is poor and common methods used to makes messages more visible (e.g. pop-ups, sound, and flash/motion);</span></p>
<p><span>Design implications regarding our limited short term and long term memory; how recognition and learning from experience for readers is typically easy while problem solving and recall is hard;</span></p>
<p><span>And, a discussion of time requirements for systems designers to consider.</span></p>
<p><span>Written in an easy-to-understand narrative, lecture-format with dozens of illustrations in each chapter, readers will find this book to be a delightful and welcome primer detailing the fundamental psychological principles behind effective design rules.""</span></p>

<p>No food at this event. After party instead at Trali Irish Pub's NEW LOCATION (see special instructions).</p>
<p>Description: <br />

Big data is expected to play a crucial role in the cybersecurity landscape. Learn how the security industry is using big data analytics and integrating Artificial Intelligence techniques (statistical analysis, autonomic/agent-based computing, ensemble classification, game-theoretic self-optimization) within the framework of distributed, intelligent, and forward-thinking security architecture. For example, Cisco is using these techniques to create solutions in the domain of Network Behavior Analysis (NBA), in order fight against modern sophisticated attacks in today's cyberspace, including Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), exploit kits, zero-day attacks, molymorphic malware and trojans inside the client's network.</p>
<p>**Special Instructions: <br />

Cisco is security conscious (Duh). Members will need to be escorted to the conference room from the lobby. Please inform the security desk that you are there for Research Triangle Analysts and that Omar Santos is the Cisco organizer.</p>
<p>Instead of having food at the event, we will gather at Trali Irish Pub's NEW LOCATION in Morrisville afterwards.</p>

<p>We'll work on our own projects most of the day - go out to lunch together (for those interested), and keep our eyes and ears open for opportunities to collaborate and help each other out.</p>

385,Learn About Graphite,"<p>This month we're happy to have Glenn from Interactive Intelligence talk to us about Graphite. A large part of DevOps is understanding what is happening with your systems so that you can react appropriately when things change (and so you know when something changes). It's all about tighter feedback loops. Graphite has become the go to choice for graphing what's happening in production systems. While Graphite isn't difficult to setup and start using, it still takes thought and consideration to make sure you're collecting useful information. Glenn is going to walk us through using Graphite and the addons that have been developed to make it even easier to use.</p>
<p>Glenn's description of his talk:</p>
<p>Graphite is an open source tool for collecting and analyzing time series data.  At Interactive Intelligence we follow the mantra of 'Collect Everything.'  This data is can prove useful for problem determination, root cause analysis, identifying performance bottlenecks, postmortems, and reporting on customer usage data and trends.  Graphite has a simple socket based interface for accepting new data and unlike other tools (like Cacti) does not require central configuration to add new metrics.  The community around Graphite continues to grow and as a result there are lots of open source products that have been built to simplify the process of integrating Graphite into your software and infrastructure stack.  We'll be covering a few of these tools as well. <br />

</p>
<p>About Glenn:</p>
<p><span>Glenn is a operations engineer at Interactive Intelligence, where his primary focus is managing, maintaining and improving the infrastructure for a SAAS based call center platform hosted in AWS.</span> <br />

396,Main Meeting: HTTP the Right Way with ASP.NET Web API - Steve Michelotti,"<p>HTTP the Right Way with ASP.NET Web API - Steve Michelotti</p>
<p>Modern web applications have seen an explosion in Web API creation. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Azure, you name it - it is becoming essential to provide a Web API so that consumers can build applications and mashups on top of your services. Web 2.0 has shown a trend away from SOAP towards a REST architecture style. With the ASP.NET Web API, Microsoft is now providing first-class support for HTTP services including tools to apply the richness of a REST architectural style. This demo heavy presentation will show how the new ASP.NET Web API will enable you to build rich HTTP services in a REST architectural style while leveraging custom media types, custom HTTP handlers, routing and more! The presentation will also cover all major features of Web API 1 as well as a preview of upcoming features in Web API 2.</p>

412,"Durham Discussion of ""Designing with the Mind in Mind""","<p><span><b>THIS EVENT HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED TO WEDNESDAY 9/11 at 6:30pm.</b> (Due to illness. Sorry for the inconvenience.)</span> <br />

</p>
<p><span>**********</span></p>
<p><span>Let's get together early September in Durham at Epocrates to discuss</span> <span>Jeff Johnson's ""Designing with the Mind in Mind."" We'll geek out over the cognitive ""why"" behind design rules and discuss the always-fascinating topic of how visual design can affect our perceptions and behaviors.</span> <br />

</p>
<p>You can buy the book here: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X"">http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Mind-Simple-Understanding-Interface/dp/012375030X</a></p>
<p>Taken from one reader's Amazon review: <br />

 <img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/e/9/4/0/event_260939712.jpeg"" style=""max-height : 700px ; max-width : 700px ; margin : 5px ; float : right""></img></p>
<p><span>""Developed from a course titled ""Human-Computer Interaction"" that he taught at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, Dr. Jeff Johnson -- who holds degrees from Yale and Stanford, experience at Xerox and author of the book, ""GUI Bloopers"" -- offers contextual explanations as to how we visualize and categorize information, data and images in such a manner that engineers and programmers can design user interfaces in the most effective manner. It's a well-written, insightful and very practical guide that will be of interest to anyone interested in the how-and-why of computer/machine interface design.</span> <br />

 <br />

 <span>Topics covered include:</span></p>
<p><span>How our visual perceptions are biased by experience, the current context, and user's intentions/goals;</span></p>
<p><span>How our vision is optimized to see structure; Gestalt principles of proximity, continuity, closure, symmetry, figure/ground separation and then how they are combined;</span></p>
<p><span>How structure enhances people's ability to scan long numbers; how visual hierarchy enables readers to focus on the most relevant information;</span></p>
<p><span>A discussion of psychological theory that indicates than we're ""wired for language, but not for reading"" and the design implications of these findings;</span></p>
<p><span>Limitations of our color vision and implications for how color is presented in user interfaces; the fact that user's peripheral vision is poor and common methods used to makes messages more visible (e.g. pop-ups, sound, and flash/motion);</span></p>
<p><span>Design implications regarding our limited short term and long term memory; how recognition and learning from experience for readers is typically easy while problem solving and recall is hard;</span></p>
<p><span>And, a discussion of time requirements for systems designers to consider.</span></p>
<p><span>Written in an easy-to-understand narrative, lecture-format with dozens of illustrations in each chapter, readers will find this book to be a delightful and welcome primer detailing the fundamental psychological principles behind effective design rules.""</span></p>

<p><span>Parking: <br />

 • Free lot next to Fishmonger’s on Main Street. <br />

 • Paid lot (Epocrates will validate) in front of Morgan Imports/Parker &amp; Otis also off of Main St at the corner of Main and Gregson. <br />

</span> <span>To get to the meeting room, walk down Gregson towards Brightleaf Square to the back of the second building. On that corner there’s an awning with a door underneath it (look for a TriUXPA sign). Go through that door, left through the next door. On the immediate right is our meeting room (look for the Epocrates logo and another TriUXPA sign).</span> <span> <br />

</span></p>
<p><span>Location Protip: bring a sweater. For some reason the air conditioning in that room is out of control.</span></p>

453,austin lucas,"<H4>Austin Lucas</H4>
<P>Raised in the backwoods country of Monroe County, Indiana, Austin Lucas was born into a folk and bluegrass lineage. His father, Bob Lucas, is an accomplished musician and performer in his own right, having earned songwriting credits on two of Allison Krauss’ albums. Learning to harmonize before learning to read, Lucas honed his vocal control as a member of the nationally-acclaimed Indiana University Children’s Choir. In a narrative as well-worn as it is true, Lucas rebelled against his upbringing, leaving his Americana roots for the catharsis of punk rock. After the better part of a decade spent criss-crossing the globe with a series of bands in broken-down vans, Lucas hit a musical glass-ceiling, eventually finding respite for his ringing ears in the delicacy of traditional songcraft.</P>
<P>Singing with the conviction of a preacher bereft of his faith, Lucas tackles recurrent themes of the soul, sin as personal purgatory, and the possibility of finding redemption in this life. The fallacies of man take center stage as the righteous false prophet is denounced as a “hollow vessel with unsteady hands.” Turning the harsh light of hindsight on himself, Lucas addresses the hard lessons learned in the passing of youth, ruminating on the failures and missed opportunities, pledging, “If there’s a light shining/ Point the way there/ A straight way of walking/ I’ll be like an arrow.”</P>
<P>Following his solo debut, The Common Cold (2006), Lucas has steadily built upon his recorded output, releasing Putting The Hammer Down (2007), the Bristle Ridge (2008) collaboration with Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music, and Somebody Loves You (2009), which debuted at #7 on the Billboard Bluegrass chart. Culminating with his fourth album, A New Home In The Old World (2011), Lucas has consistently evolved and grown as a musician and songwriter, resting on no laurels and developing the songs’ framework further with each successive album.</P>
<P>Having raised his profile on the road with Willie Nelson’s Country Throwdown tour, the troubadour-packed Revival tour, and in support of Pennsylvania’s Langhorne Slim, Lucas has also bolstered his loyal grassroots following with appearances at the Philadelphia Folk Festival, Canada’s Sled Island Festival, Florida’s Harvest of Hope, and a 2011 European tour. Folk music is for the common folk, and Lucas delivers, often ending his shows playing on the floor amidst the crowd. Lucas will tour extensively through 2013, sweeping through Australia in January before heading to SXSW Music Festival in Austin, TX in March, then to Europe in March/April, followed by a US headlining tour with dates to be announced in the coming weeks.</P>

454,Cat's Cradle Presents: Cults,"<H4>Cults</H4>
<DIV>Static is a breakup album. Just not in the way we think of a breakup album. That cold knot in your stomach when you lose someone? That is not longing for a person. That is dread, uncertainty of what comes next. Madeline Follin and Brian Oblivion of Cults are both 24 years old. Today most people of that age, if not all of us, carry this cold knot inside. “There’s a feeling our generation has. The feeling there’s always something better around the corner, that everyone is born to be a star,” Brian says. “The feeling that life is waiting for you, and yet it’s not happening. All of that is static.” Static. The white noise that comes when a signal is lost, or when there are too many signals. What causes an electric shock when two people touch. But also, immobility, distortion. Television is a heavy influence on Cults. Before the first Cults show, Brian ran to the Salvation Army to pick up old TV set to decorate the stage. Brian Oblivion, his stage name, is lifted from a professor in the movie Videodrome, a guy who only appears as a face on a television. Brian has five televisions in his house. Brian says, “I was thinking about the idea of static being all possible frequencies at once—the everything. I could just stare at it forever.” The final track on this new Cults record, “No Hope,” opens and ends with the sound of broadcasting static. “Burn down the bridges…forget tomorrow,” Madeline sings sweetly on the song. Cults has always been a band to look to both past and present. When the young duo arrived on the New York scene in 2010 with the perfectly formed debut single “Go Outside,” it was described as Phil Spector with hip-hop sensibilities, glee soaked in reverb. Sometimes, when Madeline’s friends heard the song, they asked her how they got little boys to sing on it. “That’s just me!” she told them. In fact, if you ask Brian to name his favorite album, he’ll name Home Schooled: The ABCs of Kid Soul, a compilation by the Numero Group, a collection of lost, old R&B recorded by children. Brian adores the the crate-digging Chicago reissue label and its dusty, forgotten music. “Whenever we make songs, I picture imaginary bands,” he says. What make-believe bands can be heard on Static? “I Can Hardly Make You Mine” is Petula Clark pounding a “Downtown” piano beat while fronting a Jesus and Mary Chain maelstrom. The bouncing, shimmering “Always Forever” and “We’ve Got It” rocket girl-group doo-wop into the shoegazer dream-pop stratosphere. “High Road” gallops through a spaghetti western soundscape in a sandstorm of strings and organ, like Morricone teaching us how to walk like an Egyptian. Though such fantasy might be too shallow for the record’s emotional centerpiece, “Were Before,” a duet that is quintessential Cults. “We both needed our own world, just the way were before,” Brian and Madeline sing at the same time, though not necessarily together. Static is funkier and denser than its predecessor, something immediately apparent from the cool strut of “High Road.” “I started out as a bass player,” Brian says. “That’s how I write songs, on bass.” Oblivion then fleshes the songs out with drums, guitar, piano, farfisa, strings, layers and layers. He plays just about all of the sounds on Static himself, save for slide guitar. “Everything today is party, party, dance, dance nonstop,” Brian says. “There’s room for more moody and introspective dance music. We wanted to make a groovy record.” There’s a cliché that claims you have your whole life to make your debut album and one year to make your second. The immediacy of internet fame has killed that. Brian and Madeline were raised in San Diego and both attended film school in New York City. At 21, the two moved in together in Manhattan. Cults began merely as apartment hobby, with Brian fiddling with fragments of tunes and Madeline trilling on top. They put songs online. In a matter of days, the two were receiving fan e-mails and gig offers. From there, the blogs quickly sniffed them out. Soon, a contract with Columbia. A tour that lasted nearly three years. A self-titled 2011 debut recorded in schedule gaps. Lollapalooza, All Tomorrows Parties, Bonnaroo, Pitchfork. Malmö, Singapore, Buffalo, Melbourne. By the end of the cycle, Cults were exhausted and separated. Brian and Madeline began recording Static with friend Shane Stoneback, who co-produced their debut. The process was the same as ever. “I’d be in one room working on lyrics. Brian would be working on finishing a song. We’d come to the point where we couldn’t get any further and switch places.” Madeline enjoyed having a set schedule. She stopped having panic attacks. The former couple found they worked better than when they were together. “We were not as afraid to speak the truth.” Despite any newfound ease with internal criticism, Cults were bursting with ideas—and recordings. The group found itself with six different versions of songs. “It was my fault,” Brian admits. “If you’re working with a friend, it’s easier to forget you’re spending money.” So the two decided to finish the record with someone they have never worked with before. Cults took the tracks to Atlanta and producer Ben Allen. They worked in a studio filled with vintage lunch boxes and a control room made of an abandoned boxcar. The fun part in Georgia was hacking away. That string part they worked on for two days? Fuck it, throw it out. Slashing at the songs felt invigorating. Because really, that is the question lying beneath Static: What can you live without?</DIV>

Fast forward almost a year later and UserVoice is almost ready to launch the <a href=""http://uservoice.com/touchpoint-toolkit"">Touchpoint Toolkit</a>. It's been a year entirely consumed by the design of a single widget. At times it seems like John's entire design life has been confined to a 300x300 pixel box. This has been both challenging and rewarding.</p>

</span><span> <br />

There is no food at this event. After party instead at Trali Irish Pub's NEW LOCATION (see special instructions).</span><span> <br />

</span></p>
<p><span>Description:  <br />

Big data is expected to play a crucial role in the cybersecurity landscape. Learn how the security industry is using big data analytics and integrating Artificial Intelligence techniques (statistical analysis, autonomic/agent-based computing, ensemble classification, game-theoretic self-optimization) within the framework of distributed, intelligent, and forward-thinking security architecture. For example, Cisco is using these techniques to create solutions in the domain of Network Behavior Analysis (NBA), in order fight against modern sophisticated attacks in today's cyberspace, including Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), exploit kits, zero-day attacks, molymorphic malware and trojans inside the client's network. <br />

</span></p>
<p><span>**Special Instructions:  <br />

Cisco is security conscious. Members will need to be escorted to the conference room from the lobby. Please inform the security desk that you are there for Research Triangle Analysts meeting and that Omar Santos is the Cisco organizer.</span></p>
<p><span>Instead of having food at the event, we will gather at Trali Irish Pub's NEW LOCATION in Morrisville afterwards: <a href=""http://www.traliirishpub.com/new-location"">http://www.traliirishpub.com/new-location</a></span></p>

423,September Triangle OpenStack Meetup: RDO Learning Lab,"<p>Agenda:</p>
<p>4:30pm: Welcome and Introductions</p>
<p>4:45pm: Hands-on RDO Workshop with Dan Radez, Red Hat  (details below) </p>
<p>5:45pm: Pizza courtesy of Cisco</p>
<p>The workshop will provide hands on experience installing and getting started with RDO, Red Hat's community packaging of OpenStack, on RHEL 6.  We have approximately 22 workstations set up in the room for participants to actually install RDO.  <span>Once OpenStack is installed we will add a user, add a boot image, start an instance, create and attach a volume to the instance and explore file operations with Swift.  Want to read up ahead of time?  Check out: <a href=""http://openstack.redhat.com/"">http://openstack.redhat.com/</a>  </span></p>
<p><span>If you're following along at home, you may want to install RHEL or CentOS 6 and set up the Grizzly repository before the meetup begins (refer to <a href=""http://openstack.redhat.com/Quickstart"" class=""linkified"">http://openstack.redhat.com/Quickstart</a>).</span></p>
<p>To get to Red Hat:</p>
<p>* Take I-40 to the South Saunders north exit (298B).</p>
<p>* Follow S Saunders into downtown; stay in the right lane when you get close. </p>
<p>* Turn right on south st. and left on Wilmington st.</p>
<p>* On Wilmington, after you cross Cabarrus St. turn right into the parking deck after the service entrance.</p>
<p> <br />

It will cost a few dollars to park in the deck.  Note that parking spaces with yellow lines are 3 hour spots.  Most people can just park in the yellow spots right by the elevator.  Take the elevator to the first floor and check in with the security desk in the lobby.  You will be escorted to the training room by Red Hat staffers. <br />

424,Tucker Lake,"<p>Tucker Lake is a lake in Benson where people can swim and play.  Admission is $14 and it is CASH ONLY (they have an ATM outside, but I'm sure there's a finance fee.  Admission gets you access to all the features include paddle boats/boards, kayaks, rope swings, a 167 ft. water slide, and the Aqua Glide water gym!  There is wakeboarding as well, but it's an additional fee.  You can bring chairs, floats, food, and non alcoholic drinks.  No pets.</p>
<p>We thought it would be easiest to meet together to carpool.  So we're going to meet at Kentwood park at 11:30 and eat lunch (bring your own) and then we'll head to Tucker Lake.  It's about 45 minutes away.  It closes at 6, so at the latest, we'll still be back in Raleigh by 7.</p>

428,The Story behind the User Story – Acceptance Test Driven Design,"<p>Nearly everyone in the agile community is using User Stories to represent features and functionality. But there is more to a User <br />

Story than the <br />

I want… <br />

So that… <br />

 <br />

phrasing. Many forget that good user stories also have acceptance tests (conditions of acceptance) as part of their definition. And these are much more than simple…tests.</p>
<p> <br />

In this collaborative meeting we’ll be breaking into sub-groups and brainstorming stories for a hypothetical ATM application. Along the way, we’ll be writing, comparing, and learning how acceptance tests can drive better, higher quality, and customer centric features. <br />

 <br />

Come prepared to write, discuss, and improve your stories, with a focus on Acceptance Tests.Acceptance Test-Driven Development</p>

<p>Since many of us get to the meeting early, we will make a half-hour available as a meet-eat-and-greet time prior to any presentations or shop talk. We will continue to start formally at 7:30pm, but the time change is to reflect this chatting time.</p>
<p>Since we all usually chat as people arrive, we will not continue to do a round-robin greeting at 7:30pm. We will instead end the greeting period with announcements, and then give the floor to the presenter or moderator.</p>

443,"Learn About Chef, Hands On","<p>I'm happy to announce that in addition to our normal October meetup on the 16th, we're having a special meetup on the 9th. This meetup is going to be a hands on tutorial with Chef. </p>
<p>Sean Carolan, one of Opscode's consultants, is going to be in town for a <a href=""http://www.opscode.com/blog/event/2-day-chef-fundamentals-raleigh-nc/"">two day Chef fundamental's class</a> and while he's here he's agreed to give a one hour Chef bootcamp to the group.</p>
<p>For this event you're encouraged to bring your laptop and code along. We'll be at Argyle Social, who will be providing chairs and desks for you to work at. Given the hands on nature of this talk, we're limiting the size so it can be as effective as possible for everyone who attends. </p>
<p>Even if you're a Chef expert you're still welcome to attend, help others, and have your questions answered by Sean.</p>
<p>There will be no pizza, but there will be some light snacks and drinks provided.</p>
<p>It starts at 7pm, with doors opening at 6:45pm. </p>
<p> <br />

</p>
<p>Here is how Sean describes his talk:</p>
<p><span>Zero to Chef in 60 Minutes. During this hands-on session we'll show you how to set up a Chef workstation and configure a virtual web server in less than an hour.  Optional:  Bring a wifi-enabled laptop if you'd like to participate in the hands-on workshop.  </span> <br />

</p>
<p>About Sean:</p>
<p>Sean Carolan is an Opscode automation consultant based in Austin, Texas.  In his past life he was a Unix systems administrator at Electronic Arts where he helped automate the build process for thousands of game servers.  Previous to that Sean automated server builds at Peoplefluent, an HR SaaS company.  In his spare time Sean enjoys tinkering with robots and embedded platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi.   </p>
<p> <br />

</p>
<p>Hopefully this kind of event is helpful. Let the organizers know what you think and as the opportunity arises we'll try to schedule more of these for Chef and the other configuration management tools.</p>

444,Learn About Netflix OSS,"<p>For October Andrew Spyker is going to speak to the group on Netflix's Open Source Software. In his position at IBM Andrew and his team have been making heavy use of it. </p>
<p>I think it's best to let him describe his talk:</p>
<p><span>This talk with focus on lessons learned across my team's historical use of Acme Air (</span><a href=""http://github.com/acmeair/acmeair"">http://github.com/acmeair/acmeair</a><span>) as a sample and benchmark across multiple clouds.  The focus will be on the work done with the Netflix OSS platform as documented in the following blog post </span><a href=""http://ispyker.blogspot.com/2013/07/acme-air-goes-to-streaming-movies.html""></a><a href=""http://ispyker.blogspot.com/2013/07/acme-air-goes-to-streaming-movies.html"">http://ispyker.blogspot.com/2013/07/acme-air-goes-to-streaming-movies.html</a><span>.  </span></p>
<p><span>Live demos will be shown performing operational procedures on the sample application in a EC2 and IBM SoftLayer and RightScale environment.  Base server runtime capability to enable cloud operations will be covered including Karyon, Ribbon, Hystrix and Eureka Client.  Distributed naming services and approach to HA ELB will cover Eureka, Priam and Zuul.  Finally the operational console for developers - Asgard will be covered.  Other operational concepts such as Ice and Edda will minimally covered, with a limited focus.  The tour of the Netflix OSS platform will be complemented with a view of why such an approach is used at Netflix.  I expect some of the decisions made at Netflix on approach to devops and architecture will generate interesting discussion as it has in the industry </span><span>(</span><a href=""http://www.informationweek.com/cloud-computing/platform/how-netflix-is-ruining-cloud-computing/240151650"">http://www.informationweek.com/cloud-computing/platform/how-netflix-is-ruining-cloud-computing/240151650</a>).</p>
<p> <br />

</p>
<p>How Andrew describes himself:</p>
<p><span>In my position, my mission is to advance the state of performance of all IBM runtimes contributing to our cloud, mobile, social, and analytics platforms. While my main passion is focused on programming models and server runtimes to support these platforms, I also focus on the optimized delivery of these solutions across software as a service, appliance, workload optimized systems, and traditional software delivery form factors. I continue to leverage my deep experience in core application infrastructure applying the lessons learned to connectivity, process, cloud/management, and smarter planet initiatives within the IBM WebSphere brand and beyond.</span> <br />

</p>
<p>In advancing the state of performance, I direct our product performance efforts internally, shape the future of industry standard benchmarks, and help specific customers be successful with their deployments of the IBM technologies and solutions.</p>
<p> <br />

</p>
<p>We'll be at WebAssign. TEKSystems is providing pizza. As usual, it all kicks off at 7pm with doors opening at 6:45pm.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing everyone there.</p>

 <br />

From the Facebook page--This month, we've decided to relax things a bit for our Professionals meeting. Please join us at Tyler's Taproom in Apex, NC on Monday November 18th at 7:30 pm for drinking, noshing, and socializing with the local development community. Developers, indies, and journalists are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>TRANSPORTATION: Amanda will have to be in Apex by 6:30 pm to make sure things are arranged properly and for the BoD meeting, but she's got room for three extra people in her Ford Focus. Contact her if you live in Chapel Hill or along the route to Apex, and she'll see if she can work something out with you. <br />

</p>
<p>Along those same lines, Amanda will be creating a thread on the forum boards about carpooling. We encourage all of you to see if you can lend a seat to your fellow members if you've got one to spare. <br />

</p>
<p>------------------------------ <br />

 <br />

Pretty sure we are FAR past time for a social gathering. Time for us to catch up and see who is doing what and talk about things past, present, and future.

455,One Beat,"<H4>About One Beat</H4>
<P>OneBeat is an international cultural exchange that celebrates the transformative power of the arts through the creation of original, inventive music, and people-to-people diplomacy. More than a performance program, OneBeat balances three principles: dialogue, creation, and social engagement to foster mutual understanding and cooperation among citizens of the world. By giving international artists from abroad and the United States creative opportunities to interact, OneBeat furthers these vital goals, one unexpected musical piece at a time. OneBeat is a musical journey like no other. It is a chance for adventurous musicians from an incredible diversity of traditions to seek common ground, create new musical combinations, push the boundaries of music technology, and find ways to involve all members of society in the process of musical creativity. OneBeat endeavors to be the nexus of a new way of thinking about how music can connect people from across the world and around the block. OneBeat consists of a two week Residency, when Fellows create original material and develop workshop ideas to engage local communities, and a two-week Tour, when Fellows give performances, collaborate with local musicians and lead workshops with youth and communities groups. OneBeat Fellows work with a diverse group of expert Collaborating Artists—including luminaries of classical music, hip-hop, jazz and more—to develop and deepen the scope of their collaborative work. In 2012, 32 musicians (ages 19-35) from 21 countries gave 17 public performances for more than 3000 people, conducted a dozen workshops for more than 1000 participants, and appeared in 500 photos, 75 original short films and dozens of recorded tracks. In the fall of 2013, 25 musicians from around the world will come together in the U.S. for four weeks to collaboratively write, produce, and perform original music, and develop ways that music can make a positive impact on our local and global communities OneBeat is an initiative of the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. The Bureau supports U.S. foreign policy by fostering mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries through academic, cultural, sports, and professional exchanges that engage women, youth, underserved communities, educators, artists, athletes, and rising leaders in the U.S. and more than 160 countries. <EM>One BeatSM is an initiative of the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, administered by Bang on a Can’s Found Sound Nation.</EM> <A TITLE=""One Beat Website"" HREF=""http://www.1beat.org/"" TARGET=""_blank"">One Beat Website</A></P>

<p>There is no food at this event. After party instead at Trali Irish Pub's NEW LOCATION (see special instructions).</p>
<p>Description: <br />

 Big data is expected to play a crucial role in the cybersecurity landscape. Learn how the security industry is using big data analytics and integrating Artificial Intelligence techniques (statistical analysis, autonomic/agent-based computing, ensemble classification, game-theoretic self-optimization) within the framework of distributed, intelligent, and forward-thinking security architecture. For example, Cisco is using these techniques to create solutions in the domain of Network Behavior Analysis (NBA), in order fight against modern sophisticated attacks in today's cyberspace, including Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), exploit kits, zero-day attacks, molymorphic malware and trojans inside the client's network.</p>
<p>**Special Instructions: <br />

 Cisco is security conscious. Members will need to be escorted to the conference room from the lobby. Please inform the security desk that you are there for Research Triangle Analysts meeting and that Omar Santos is the Cisco organizer.</p>

478,Regular Meeting of the AMG (Intro to Arduino),"<p>Its time for our next open meeting of the Alamance Makers Guild!</p>
<p>The special topic for this meeting will be an introduction to the Arduino Micro Controller by AMG Member Danny Oakley. Arduino is an entire microcomputer on a chip that is designed to be easy to use (both electrically and from a programming perspective). This demonstration will be kept open and interesting for non-electronics/non-programmer folks but should also be interesting to anyone who has more advanced knowledge. Arduino is inexpensive and is a great platform for robotics, automation, or creating interactive art projects. There are even forms of the Arduino that can be sewn into garments to control light shows!</p>
<p>Danny will be giving an overview of what it is, where it came from, how it can be used, and what you need to know to get started. If enough folks are interested we'll schedule special more focused training sessions in the future.</p>
<p>Also on the agenda:</p>
<p>* Dinner (for those who wish to join us for $5 or more if we switch the dinner menu)... possibly MiMi's Pizza as always, possibly subs catered from Mike's Deli... vote in the comments or in your meetup responses!</p>
<p>* Quick Update on the status of various group projects (Burlington Mini Maker Faire 2014, Maker Space Progress, Teen Chapter of the AMG)</p>
<p>* Show-n-Tell... your chance to bring in YOUR projects (completed or in progress)</p>
<p>This meeting is open to all, and new members and curious passerby's are welcome and encouraged! Family Friendly as always. We encourage our new teen members and their families to also attend if available.</p>
<p>Help us spread the word, share info about this meeting to your friends and through social media!</p>
<p>On the horizon: <br />

 * Make your own Puppet <br />

 * Oscilloscope Primer <br />

 * Suggest a new topic or Volunteer to teach a topic!</p>
<p>Been following us on Facebook or on Meetup.com but haven't yet come to a meeting? Make this your first meeting! Looking forward to meeting new folks!</p>",2013-10-10,2013-09-20 09:00:36.631273,2013-09-20 09:00:36.631273,http://www.meetup.com/The-Burlington-Makers-Meetup-Group/events/141116812/,The Burlington Makers Meetup Group,,

495,Triangle Buttonwood - P2P Cryptocurrency Trading,"<p>In an attempt to garner support for a Triangle Buttonwood peer-to-peer exchange, I welcome anyone interested in exchanging (or discussing) cryptocurrencies to join us at Nash Square on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are math-based currencies which aren't controlled by any central entity, but instead by a distributed computer network which secures the payment network against fraud. The first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which will likely be the dominant cryptocurrency being traded at each meetup (though all cryptocurrencies are welcome). Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Ground rules: <br />

 1. No force. <br />

 2. No fraud. <br />

 3. No coercion. <br />

 4. Have fun!</p>",2013-09-26,2013-09-26 09:00:25.629953,2013-09-26 09:00:25.629953,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/141370322/,Triangle Bitcoin Meetup,,

<p>From O'Reilly:</p>
<p>It’s the little things that turn a good digital product into a great one. With this practical book, you’ll learn how to design effective microinteractions: the small details that exist inside and around features. How can users change a setting? How do they turn on mute, or know they have a new email message?</p>
<p>Through vivid, real-world examples from today’s devices and applications, author Dan Saffer walks you through a microinteraction’s essential parts, then shows you how to use them in a mobile app, a web widget, and an appliance. You’ll quickly discover how microinteractions can change a product from one that’s tolerated into one that’s treasured.</p>
<p>• Explore a microinteraction’s structure: triggers, rules, feedback, modes, and loops</p>
<p>• Learn the types of triggers that initiate a microinteraction</p>
<p>• Create simple rules that define how your microinteraction can be used <br />

</p>
<p>• Help users understand the rules with feedback, using graphics, sounds, and vibrations <br />

524,"Durham Discussion of ""Microinteractions""","<p>Our next book that we'll be meeting to discuss Microinteractions by Dan Saffer.</p>
<p>You can buy the book directly from the publisher: <a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027676.do"" target=""_blank"" class=""linkified"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027676.do</a></p>
<p>From O'Reilly:</p>
<p>It’s the little things that turn a good digital product into a great one. With this practical book, you’ll learn how to design effective microinteractions: the small details that exist inside and around features. How can users change a setting? How do they turn on mute, or know they have a new email message?</p>
<p>Through vivid, real-world examples from today’s devices and applications, author Dan Saffer walks you through a microinteraction’s essential parts, then shows you how to use them in a mobile app, a web widget, and an appliance. You’ll quickly discover how microinteractions can change a product from one that’s tolerated into one that’s treasured.</p>
<p>• Explore a microinteraction’s structure: triggers, rules, feedback, modes, and loops</p>
<p>• Learn the types of triggers that initiate a microinteraction</p>
<p>• Create simple rules that define how your microinteraction can be used <br />

</p>
<p>• Help users understand the rules with feedback, using graphics, sounds, and vibrations <br />

</p>
<p>• Use modes to let users set preferences or modify a microinteraction <br />

</p>
<p>• Extend a microinteraction’s life with loops, such as “Get data every 30 seconds”</p>
<p> <br />

1242,Lightening Talks: Histories of Design,"<p>Remember history class where everyone had to write a paper on a person from a particular time period? Well, imagine that, but focusing on designers, presented somewhat like a Lightning Talk. ""Design"" is a broad subject, and could pertain to a lot of things. Architecture, CSS, Manufacturing, Print, City planning, Pencils! Try listening to a few episodes of 99% Invisible to get warmed up, then hit the library to learn more about who designed your favorite things!</p> <p><br/>Suggested Topics . . .</p> <p>WWW<br/>The World Wide Web has done a particularly poor job of keeping track of its historical moments. Many are locked away in peoples' memories. You could focus on the life of a particular designer through their blogs, archive.org, and really just by Surfing The Web — your favorite thing to do anyway.</p> <p><a href=""https://archive.org/web/""><a href=""https://archive.org/web/"" class=""linkified"">https://archive.org/web/</a></a> might be useful.</p> <p><br/>Print<br/>Gutenberg wasn't the only important person in print history. Not even close! Who invented CMYK? Who invented silkscreens? Who invented PostScript .. and why would they do such a thing? I don't know the answers to these questions, but about 15 minutes from you might, and then you can tell everyone about it!</p> <p>Computer Graphics<br/>A long trail of computer graphics history awaits your discovery in the forms of whitepapers written by huddles of PhDs at MIT and Utah.

Along the way we will do a bit of Code First Migration, continue to refactor and clean up the code, then introduce Ninject to take it another notch up. <br />

Time permitting we may even do a bit of WebApi to see one other way to reuse our service layer. <br />

588,TA3M,"<p>You're invited to the October Techno-Activism Third Mondays (TA3M) in Durham! TA3M is an informal meetup designed to connect software creators and activists who are interested in censorship, surveillance, and open technology. The event takes place in different cities around the globe every third Monday of the month. <br />

 <br />

WHAT: TA3M in Durham [1,2] <br />

WHEN: Monday October 21st from 7pm 'till 9pm <br />

WHERE: SplatSpace [3] <br />

TOPIC: Lightning Talks and Hack Night <br />

 <br />

TA3M is explicitly informal and open. You're invited to hack the process, ask questions, and be critical. You are very welcome to join in if you have something you want to share or discuss. <br />

 <br />

This month we'll be having ""lightning talks"" [4], followed by a hack night. The focus for the lightning talks will be an open Internet: tools, policy, and anything related to an Internet free from censorship and surveillance. We've already got a few talks lined up. Do you have ideas you'd like to share? We'd love to hear them. No advance registration is required. Just show up ready to present. Each talk will run 5-10 minutes. A laptop will be hooked up to the projector for slides, if you want to use slides. <br />

 <br />

Following the lightning talks we'll have a hack night to work on anything open Internet related, with a focus on what we've looked at in previous meetings (Tor, Tails, ownCloud, and GPG.) Is there anything about your setup that's not working, or you'd like to change?  Bring it to hack night and let's see what we can do! This part of the meeting will last for as long as folks want to stay. <br />

 <br />

RSVP optional. <br />

631,Version Control Systems,"<p>Have you ever lost hours of development because a hard drive failed or you lost your usb drive? Have you ever had to collaborate on a coding project with several people and wondered if there was a way to avoid the associated headaches? Have you ever coded yourself into a corner and wished you could go back to where you were the day before? These are not uncommon problems, but there is a common solution called version control.</p>
<p>In this talk, Richard Brantley, will introduce you to the concept version control systems, list the advantages gained by using them, and give you a great introductory tutorial using GitHub, one of the most popular version control systems currently being used by developers.</p>
<p>In the tutorial you will learn the basics of:</p>
<p>The difference between Git and GitHub <br />

Copying a Git source code repository (cloning) <br />

Commenting and adding your changes locally (committing) <br />

Uploading your changes to GitHub (pushing) <br />

Reverting to a previous version (resetting) <br />

Working on different versions of a repo (branching) <br />

Requesting your version (branch) of a GitHub repo be added (submitting a pull request) <br />

And, adding pull requests to a GitHub repo you are responsible for (merging)</p>

632,The Human Experience of Change,"<p>As IT specialists, we constantly help our business colleagues navigate the ups and downs of changes in their systems and processes. The most effective agents of change also know how to guide themselves and others through the ""human experience of change.""</p>
<p>When change shows up in their lives, people experience a whirlwind of responses: excitement and alarm, curiosity and anxiety, determination and apathy, and more. We have a name for this confusing yet unavoidable state: chaos. Emotional or psychological chaos. How do you cope with this confusing and disruptive state? How do you relate to others who are experiencing chaos of their own? How could you work more effectively in the presence of chaos to guide people through difficult changes?</p>
<p>In this session you will:</p>
<p><b>Analyze</b> how your own experiences of change match a simple model of the change process.</p>
<p><b>Distinguish</b> how the CHAOS phase of change shows up for you.</p>
<p><b>Identify</b> how you tend to cope with the experience of CHAOS brought about by change.</p>
<p><b>Develop</b> new possibilities for helping yourself and others to navigate change effectively</p>

793,QS Show & Tell - Your connected phone: Wi-Fi vs Cellular,"<p>In the tradition of QS show and tells, this meeting will be structured as follows</p>
<p>6:30 - 7:00PM - free socializing time</p>
<p>7:00 - 8:00PM - quick presentations on people's ongoing projects. Tim Jones from Republic Wireless will share some interesting statistics around consumer wifi and cellular use. Should be fun!</p>
<p>Presentations should take a maximum of ten minutes and should answer three principal questions: What did you do? How did you do it? What did you learn? A good rule of thumb is to cover include 6-8 slides. Please send the slides/topics to me in advance in and I will add your information and topic of discussion to the meetup description so that other people can come to hear you speak.

But, how do we get to that next level to transform ourselves and our communities?</p> <p>We’ll need to journey into uncharted territory, and that’s risky. We tend to avoid risk because of FEAR --  fear of the unknown, fear of failure, or fear of consequences.

608,Review WordCamp and Let's Talk Project Management,"<p><strong>WordCamp Raleigh</strong></p>
<p>We will discuss the upcoming WordCamp Raleigh on November 23/24 at the College Of Engineering at North Carolina State University.</p>
<p>Here is <a href=""http://2013.raleigh.wordcamp.org/"">the website</a> for registration.</p>
<p>The organizers of WordCamp Raleigh also operate Semper Fi Web Design in Durham and run the WordPress Raleigh Meetup. They are the creators of the All In One SEO Pack Plugin, which is the most popular SEO plugin for WordPress.</p>
<p>WordCamp's are super-WordPress Meetups that are 2-day workshops organized by the community. There are usually Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced tracks, which you can attend. Generally speaking, most WordCamp's are videotaped, so that if you can't attend, you can watch some of the sessions you might have missed on WordPress TV. However, not all sessions make it to the site.</p>
<p>In the past, I have presented at various WordCamp's in New York City and Raleigh. This year, I'll be doing a session on WordPress for Music Sites.</p>
<p><strong>Project Management</strong></p>
<p>While many of us love using WordPress for our sites and blogs, we often don't talk about project management. As the founder of Digital Strategy Works and someone who has worked in Product Development and Project Management since founding my first start-up, Netmix, in 1995, I have learned a lot about how to run a web development project.</p>
<p>There's the old way, which is known as ""waterfall."" What that means is that you spend months gathering every single requirement that you want to have for your website or blog, then launch a ship, which can sometimes be bloated with features that really weren't all the necessary. But, because everyone in the business had an idea, all those ideas were then funneled in a huge document. The site took a year or two to build. And, once you launched it, most of the features you spent years building were obsolete by the time you finished the project.</p>
<p>Today, we have a new method galled ""agile,"" which focuses on a MVP or ""minimum (minimal) viable product). This is where you build the bare bones of what you need for launch. Then, you advance your project over time using ""scrum"" or ""kanban,"" which are two philosophies of how to identify the priorities and build just what you need now, then prioritize your new features and enhancements over time.</p>
<p>Some uneducated Business Owners hate on the agile process, because it doesn't give them everything they want NOW. But, that is shortsighted on the business owner's part, because not only does it take time to build everything, but you also have to support what you've built. Meaning that you have to provide tools for customer support to change user information or take care of other issues.</p>
<p>We'll talk about why it's important to manage your project with patience and perseverance, instead of responding out of fear that you don't have every feature or function you think you need to build your business or someone else's.</p>

861,Intro to Scikit-Learn with Tim Hopper,"<p>Abstract: Scikit-learn is an actively developed Python package providing an implementation of many machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM, kNN, linear models, HMM, k-Means, spectral clustering). However, the benefits of Scikit-learn goes well beyond carefully implemented learning algorithms. Being built in Python, it allows easy integration with countless other Python modules for tasks such as plotting, data munging, and application development. Its consistent API across algorithms allows for rapid experimentation with multiple learning methods. Also, Scikit-learn is well documented and provides lots of examples.</p> <p>Instead of discussing particular machine learning algorithms provided by the package, I will focus on Scikit-learn and Python as a toolkit for solving data problems from start to finish. I will emphasize the Pipeline tool which allows the user to chain together all the steps of a machine learning pipeline including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and model fitting.</p>",2014-01-16,2014-01-07 09:02:25.351595,2014-01-07 09:02:25.351595,http://www.meetup.com/Research-Triangle-Analysts/events/156645712/,Research Triangle Analysts,,

544,"WordPress Free, Premium and Child Themes and Theme Frameworks","<p>At our last Meetup, a number of folks were interested in WordPress themes - how to find a good them, who to trust, what makes a good theme and even how to build a theme.</p>
<p>For this meeting, we'll discuss:</p>
<p>- What is a theme?</p>
<p>We'll break down what a theme actually is, how it works and what it looks like under the hood. We'll show you how themes are installed into WordPress and how you can select from your various themes.</p>
<p>- Where to find great themes</p>
<p>We'll talk about free vs. paid themes and what to watch out for. We'll review where you can get a high quality theme and what the costs and benefits are to the themes you might choose for your blog or website. We're only going to scratch the surface, because there's a lot to cover, but you should walk away know where to find the theme you need for your project or client.</p>
<p>- Theme Frameworks and Child Theming</p>
<p>Today, there are ""theme frameworks"" that have all the base elements of what a theme should contain, such as a header, footer, sidebar, primary font, heading font, paragraph font and more. We'll talk about why theme frameworks are good and why they actually might not be good for your project. We'll also cover creating ""child themes"" for theme frameworks, that modify the base theme to include colors and style. And, we'll cover how graphical assets are delivered by the designer and how they are cut and coded into WordPress themes.</p>
<p>This workshop is considered beginner for part of the meetup when discussing where to find and install themes and intermediate to advanced for the other part of how to develop a child theme for a theme framework. For the first part, we won't be very technical. For the second, we'll be talking about taking Photoshop files and converting them into HTML and CSS, as well as a bit of PHP , so that you can understand how themes are structured.</p>

547,Ben Seretan,"<H4>Ben Seretan</H4>
<P>Since 2011, Ben has released three solo recordings, a collaborative LP with Portland band the Early, and a live recording with the Ben Seretan Group on WFMU. He's also played lots and lots of shows.<BR> Ben grew up in Southern California, in Orange County. When he was a kid, he went to church and played the cello. Then he went out to school, at Wesleyan University, studying with such weirdo music luminaries as Alvin Lucier and Anthony Braxton. After briefly living in rural Missouri, Ben moved to Brooklyn. He's lived there since. In 2012, Ben was an artist in residence at the Wassaic Project. In 2013, Ben was named one of the Sitka Fellows. He lived and worked in southeast Alaska for most of that summer.</P>

<H4>Alameda</H4>
<P>Weaned in the mile-high confines of Denver, Colorado, the core of Portland chamber-folk collective Alameda—guitarist/vocalist Stirling Myles, and cellist/vocalist Jessie Dettwiler—have weathered their share of evolutions during their musical marriage. Beginning as half of instrumental post-rock outfit Strangers Die Every Day, Myles and Dettwiler had already cultivated a unique understanding for the sonic properties of strings, and the beauty in voiceless aural planes.</P>
<P>""Now a quintet bearing a new LP, they have truly evolved their brand of heartfelt Americana, deepening the lushness and musicality that accompanies their hardscrabble vocals. True to its name, “Slow Beginnings” has a somber start that unfolds into a humble orchestra of piano keys, backing songstresses and nimble guitars."" - RCRD LBL</P>

846,Fields of Mars / Houda Idrissi / Lex Antenna,"<H4>Fields of Mars</H4>
<P>If every musician is searching for that elusive sound that they hear in their heads then that would make Erich (Three Days In Vegas, Psycho Sonic Cindi) no different than the rest. He has said that it is like “musical sounds capes bouncing around like bells reverberating off the walls of some cathedral”. This was the genesis of The Fields of Mars. Erich set about bringing together old band mate Brandon Lewis (Permanent Darling, Honey Driver) on guitar and Synth and Mary Anne Barckoff (Viva La Venus) on Bass. For two months or so they crafted songs that would eventually evoke the darker side of the 80’s a sugary mixture of indie, pop, post rock. They eventually brought in filmmaker and musician in his own right Ismail Abdelkhalek on drums.</P>

She has been performing in those countries since the age of 14. Needless to say that Houda’s multicultural background has drawn to her a lot of attention among fans. In fact, Houda speaks (and sings!) in 4 different languages and attracts fans from various parts of the world!<BR> Houda Idrissi collaborated with various American and international artists namely famous French rapper Nikkfurrie from ""La Caution"" best known for their laser dance song; ""The a la Menthe"" in the OST Ocean's Twelve and photographer Keith Kapke and producer Ian Shreider.<BR> Most recently, single “You Never Existed” was selected as the theme song of California based web series Miracle Mile Girls featured in the cover of The Hollywood Reporter for Cannes in May 2013 at the Festival de Cannes.<BR> Houda is the former lead singer of Alternative Rock band Negative I and was part of the release of its highly acclaimed 1st album “Reinvention” right after her single “Cold” as a solo artist on December 2010. She is currently performing as well as working on her next album to be release in 2014.</P>

This announcement is out a bit later than normal, but I hope to see everyone next week as we hear from Nathan Walls, one of our organizers. Nathan is going to be talking to us about something that can help everyone be better at their jobs, even if it isn't technology. Communication.</p> <p>Here's how Nathan describes his talk:</p> <p>Beyond resolutions and good intentions: Improving your communication practices</p> <p>Communication is foundational for great teamwork. It's also one of the most requested areas of improvement on both personal performance evaluations and employee surveys.

958,Gainsay / Sirsy,"<H4>Gainsay</H4>
<P>Gainsay is a post hardcore, indie rock band based in Durham, NC. The band started as a conversation in early 2013 by former bandmates Ryan McKellar (Bobby's Fever, Saints Will Do, Autocade) and Dante Bruno (Saints Will Do, A Grand Social Club, The Moments After). Joe Margiotta (Radio Island, Deep Six) became part of the conversation soon after, and the 3 piece became a band. Influenced by bands like Black Flag, Fugazi, Descendants, Dinosaur Jr., Avail, Superchunk, SDRE, Jawbreaker, among others, Gainsay speaks a new, old school sound that's all their own.</P>
<P><A TITLE=""https://www.facebook.com/GainsayMusic"" HREF=""https://www.facebook.com/GainsayMusic"" TARGET=""_self"">https://www.facebook.com/GainsayMusic</A></P>
<H4>Sirsy</H4>
<P>The Boston Globe sums it up, “Little band. Big Sound.” No more needs to be said. Although the only thing “little” about Sirsy is there are just two of them. The rest is bigger than balls on a buffalo.<BR> Listen to the power in their latest recording “Coming Into Frame”. You can feel it. It’s crank-up the volume music, even when the heartfelt ballads kick in. And why so much power? Melanie Krahmer on drums and vocals, Rich Libutti on guitar. That’s why.<BR> And, according to Sirsy a lot of credit goes to Grammy-winning producers, Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade (Hole, Radiohead, Dresden Dolls, Pixies). According to Melanie, known as Mel to fans and friends alike, “Our fans have said that the energy of our live show hasn't translated onto our previous recordings. They are going to notice a different energy level on this record and it's because of how Paul and Sean worked with us."" <BR> Do you know what a click track is? It's like a metronome and is used in recording to keep things perfect. Some believe it can take away from the spontaneity of a recording artist. According to Mel, ""On some tracks, Paul and Sean didn't use a click track on purpose. The result is a few of the songs vary in tempo to suit the mood and energy of the song."" In other words the recording is real. Rich, the highly talented guitarist for Sirsy says, “It seems ridiculous to remove tempo changes. Listen to ‘The Cost Of You’. It speeds up at the end. That gives it the intensity there.”<BR> So “power” and “real” are the key words to describe the new recording and Sirsy itself. As Aftertaste Magazine said regarding Mel, “Bursting and belting out emotion and substance, she can be the queen of ‘in the groove’ rocking or be simple and delicate.” And get this, she also plays a full drum kit while standing up (she’s been featured in Modern Drummer Magazine), handles bass (played on a keyboard with her drumstick), and even throws in an occasional flute solo. Rich Libutti plays everything else, including seething guitar; bass (on a keyboard at his feet); and he is the anchor to Melanie's on stage tornado. Just the two of them because, “We never found other musicians who understood”, according to Rich.<BR> And they write. They write clever, smart songs that have more hooks than a tackle box. They both write the music. Mel takes care of the lyrics and they might set you back a few feet. They could even be called “dark” which is weird because when you talk with this duo the conversation is usually littered with laughs. But Mel says, ""Calling the lyrics dark is appropriate, or maybe introspective says it better."" She is a student of the English language and lyrics are a natural art to her. But she studies before the work begins. “I do love to listen to other artists to get inspired lyrically.” Like Coldplay, or a somewhat obscure Irish band called The Frames. And, at times when a ""more down home feel is needed"", Bruce Springsteen.<BR> “I listened to a Jackson Browne tune 'Shape of A Heart',"" Mel said, “and immediately wrote the words to our song, ‘Gold’.” “I didn't take anything directly from his song, but it set a mood for me."" In ""The Cost of You"", there is a poetic line which says, ""But I spent the cost of you"". It calls to mind, the Joni Mitchell song, “Case Of You”. But Joni’s drinking a case of him and still standing on her feet. Mel’s had it up to here. She’s done.<BR> Sirsy plays over 200 shows a year, bringing their indie rock sound to the masses and are about to expand nationally. “Coming Into Frame” will bring them beyond their east coast/mid-west comfort zone and into new territory including the south, and west coast. You will normally find them in the headline slot but they have also been special guests of such musical stalwarts as Grace Potter and the Nocturnals, Maroon5, Train, RaRaRiot, Boys Like Girls, Third Eye Blind, Lifehouse, Blues Traveler, Cheap Trick, and many more.<BR> Although the lyrics can be a little dark or introspective and the power of Sirsy can get pretty intense, “there is no sadness there”, Mel says. “On stage we radiate joy. It’s just us being free and playing music."" <BR> <BR> ”Coming Into Frame” is on Funzalo Records.</P>

714,Triangle Buttonwood - P2P Cryptocurrency Trading,"<p>In an attempt to garner support for a Triangle Buttonwood peer-to-peer exchange, I welcome anyone interested in exchanging (or discussing) cryptocurrencies to join us at Nash Square on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are math-based currencies which aren't controlled by any central entity, but instead by a distributed computer network which secures the payment network against fraud. The first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which will likely be the dominant cryptocurrency being traded at each meetup (though all cryptocurrencies are welcome). Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Ground rules: <br />

 1. No force. <br />

 2. No fraud. <br />

 3. No coercion. <br />

 4. Have fun!</p>",2013-11-21,2013-11-20 09:01:53.717145,2013-11-20 09:01:53.717145,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/151138252/,Triangle Bitcoin Meetup,,

726,Triangle Buttonwood - P2P Cryptocurrency Trading,"<p>In an attempt to garner support for a Triangle Buttonwood peer-to-peer exchange, I welcome anyone interested in exchanging (or discussing) cryptocurrencies to join us at Nash Square on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are math-based currencies which aren't controlled by any central entity, but instead by a distributed computer network which secures the payment network against fraud. The first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which will likely be the dominant cryptocurrency being traded at each meetup (though all cryptocurrencies are welcome). Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Ground rules: <br />

 1. No force. <br />

 2. No fraud. <br />

 3. No coercion. <br />

 4. Have fun!</p>",2013-11-28,2013-11-24 09:02:40.451721,2013-11-24 09:02:40.451721,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/152293102/,Triangle Bitcoin Meetup,,

In many applications, networked individuals end up on one large ""clump"", making further analysis nearly impossible.

We'll conclude the presentation with a review of performance metrics that compare detected communities with ground-truth information.</p> <p>Please join us at the after party at Cameron Bar and Grill (in Cameron Village), where you can give input on our new mission statement.

<b>Intro  To OpenSocial</b></p> <p><br/>OpenSocial is dedicated to helping all knowledge workers collaborate seamlessly at work.  We do this by developing technology for applications to connect to each other in a standard way.</p> <p>The Activity Streams standard has been a great method for allowing activities to flow across social systems, but there has not been a standard way for these activities to connect to and invoke the applications that created them.  </p> <p>To address this need, OpenSocial has launched a project being spearheaded by SugarCRM and IBM for defining Actions and Action Handlers for activity streams.  Actions define what can be done with an activity and action handlers provide a flexible mechanism for activities to “phone home” when these actions get invoked.  Now is the time to engage with OpenSocial on this idea and others like it so that we can work together to make applications Be Social Together.</p> <p><b>About Matt Marum</b></p> <p>Matt Marum has been involved with the OpenSocial Foundation for over 2 years.  Matt first was involved as the specification release manager on OpenSocial 2.0.0 and later.  Recently, Matt has been in charge of running the OpenSocial Foundation’s projects.  Matt Marum has worked for SugarCRM for a year and half and was on the core engineering team that developed Sugar 7 using PHP and Javascript.  Matt currently works as a Solutions Architect on the OEM Program at SugarCRM.  Prior to that he worked in product development and software standards with IBM Software Group.</p> <p>

<b>Parking &amp; Directions</b></p> <p>Parking is free on Duke's campus after 5pm. The closest lot is across Science Drive and slightly south of the Science Drive entrance. The elevator is right inside the entrance to the left. You'll need to be escorted up because the floor locks after 5. If no-one is waiting for you or you arrive a little late, phone numbers will be posted for you to call/text and we'll come get you.</p> <p><br/>It is very easy to access the elevator and room if you enter in the correct entrance. However, the building is very large, and if you enter from another door it would be easy to get lost. <b>Please be sure to enter the building from the entrance that faces Science Drive.</b></p>",2014-02-24,2014-02-18 03:29:23.172009,2014-02-18 03:29:23.172009,http://www.meetup.com/triupa-book-club/events/161275882/,Triangle UXPA Book Club,,

711,Irregular Meeting of the AMG: Pot-Luck Dinner + Puppet Making + Learn to Solder,"<p>Its time for our year-end holiday tradition...  <br />

<span style=""font-size : 14px"">Pot Luck Dinner + Making Something for the Holidays! (this year Puppets or Learn-to-Solder) <br />

 <br />

This event is family friendly and you are encouraged to bring out the whole family (all ages) to join us.  New members are also VERY welcome! We also hope for all the members of the Teen Chapter of the Alamance Makers Guild and their families to join us!  <br />

 <br />

NOTE: This meeting will be on the <b>3RD Thursday</b> in December <b>NOT the 2nd</b> as usual.  This is so that the maximum number of folks (especially our Puppet Master John Otero and his family) can be there.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size : 14px"">For the pot-luck dinner. All are invited to bring an item or two for dinner (home-made or store bought, main courses, side items, </span>appetizers,<span style=""font-size : 14px""> deserts, and non-alcoholic drinks are all welcome as are paper plates, cups, etc) We won't know the exact number of people eating until we get all the RSVP's but will send out an e-mail and a notice a week prior to the event with an estimate on attendance.  Please use the questions in the meetup.com meeting notice OR the comments section on our Facebook meeting page to indicate your plans for dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size : 14px"">For the Puppet Making: John Otero and Ben Harris will be bringing the base materials for puppet making to this event.  That will include foam, felt, glue, and some every-day materials. The cost to make a puppet will depend upon the number of folks who wish to make one and may range from $10 to $25 per person.  If you want to customize your puppet with clothes, glasses, jewelry, items to hold in its hands, or other special stuff (LED's or robotics for example) that is up to you to supply.  John will also share some of his templates.  If you are able please bring cardboard, scissors, xacto knives, sharpie markers, pins, coat hangers, etc. We'll post the video from the last meeting where John instructed us on Puppet Making techniques soon, and John and others will be on hand to help you out with making your puppet. We'll have more details about the Puppet Making (and costs) once everyone has RSVP'ed to the event.  Please use the questions in the meetup.com meeting notice OR the comments section on our Facebook meeting page to indicate your plans for puppet making.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size : 14px"">In addition to puppet making, we'll also have a couple of learn-to-solder stations set up for anyone who might want to solder together an LED or other electronics kit for Christmas.  Its up to you to supply your own Kit and Batteries.  You can buy kits at Radio Shack, or online from stores such as Amazon.com, Makershed, Jameco Electronics, and more. We'll have soldering irons set up in a station and will help you out if you are new to soldering.  (All children should be supervised by a parent or responsible adult for soldering). We did just soldering last year and it went over very well with lots of ornament kits made!  Please use the questions in the meetup.com meeting notice OR the comments section on our Facebook meeting page to indicate your plans for soldering a kit (or if you can volunteer to help teach others to solder).   </span></p>
<p>As always, feel free to bring items that you have made or are making for Show-N-Tell!  Photos and Video are also ok!  </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who is involved with the Alamance Makers Guild!  We hope to see as many of you and your families there as possible!  Please RSVP (yes/no/maybe) and answer all questions so we can best plan for this event.   <br />

<P>Love & War is a five-piece alternative rock band based in Raleigh, NC and composed of Bryan Mears (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), TJ Louie (keyboard, vocals), Michael Mears (bass, vocals), Stephen Luster (drums), and Ryan Collinsworth (electric guitar).<BR> <BR> Love & War represents a fusion of musical and philosophical ideals; it exists at the crossroads of blues-rock and folk, in the crucible of joy and pain. Pounding, dynamic drums and bass secure the tight groove underpinning an introspective, singer/songwriter sound. Strong melody floats over wistful acoustic guitar as harmony swells and punctuates the emotional vocals of Bryan Mears. Delicate keys are contrasted against harsh blues-based riffing from electric guitar, all culminating in a musical sound that punches you in the stomach inasmuch as it takes your breath away.</P>

808,Triangle Buttonwood - P2P Cryptocurrency Trading,"<p>In an attempt to garner support for a Triangle Buttonwood peer-to-peer exchange, I welcome anyone interested in exchanging (or discussing) cryptocurrencies to join us at Nash Square on Thursday evening.</p> <p>Cryptocurrencies are math-based currencies which aren't controlled by any central entity, but instead by a distributed computer network which secures the payment network against fraud. The first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which will likely be the dominant cryptocurrency being traded at each meetup (though all cryptocurrencies are welcome). Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>Ground rules:<br/>1. No force.<br/>2. No fraud.<br/>3. No coercion.<br/>4. Have fun!</p> <p>We meet right in the middle of Nash Square, next to the Fallen Fire Fighters Memorial.  During the winter, when it is cold and dark, we may wander over to the Brewmasters reasturant rather quickly.  Brewmasters across the street from the south west corner of Nash Square.</p>",2013-12-19,2013-12-19 09:04:35.095549,2013-12-19 09:04:35.095549,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/154872072/,Triangle Bitcoin Meetup,,

814,Fields of Mars / Houda Idrissi / Lex Antenna,"<H4>Fields of Mars</H4>
<P>If every musician is searching for that elusive sound that they hear in their heads then that would make Erich (Three Days In Vegas, Psycho Sonic Cindi) no different than the rest. He has said that it is like “musical sounds capes bouncing around like bells reverberating off the walls of some cathedral”. This was the genesis of The Fields of Mars. Erich set about bringing together old band mate Brandon Lewis (Permanent Darling, Honey Driver) on guitar and Synth and Mary Anne Barckoff (Viva La Venus) on Bass. For two months or so they crafted songs that would eventually evoke the darker side of the 80’s a sugary mixture of indie, pop, post rock. They eventually brought in filmmaker and musician in his own right Ismail Abdelkhalek on drums.</P>

<H4>Houda Idrissi</H4>
<P>Self-accomplished, determined, funny and multi-talented, there isn’t just one way to describe Houda. Her captivating voice is matched by her upbeat music and inspiring lyrics. Houda Idrissi is a Moroccan-American singer/songwriter and composer based in Raleigh, NC. Born and raised in Morocco, she relocated to the the United States for education. She has been performing in those countries since the age of 14. Needless to say that Houda’s multicultural background has drawn to her a lot of attention among fans. In fact, Houda speaks (and sings!) in 4 different languages and attracts fans from various parts of the world!<BR> Houda Idrissi collaborated with various American and international artists namely famous French rapper Nikkfurrie from ""La Caution"" best known for their laser dance song; ""The a la Menthe"" in the OST Ocean's Twelve and photographer Keith Kapke and producer Ian Shreider.<BR> Most recently, single “You Never Existed” was selected as the theme song of California based web series Miracle Mile Girls featured in the cover of The Hollywood Reporter for Cannes in May 2013 at the Festival de Cannes.<BR> Houda is the former lead singer of Alternative Rock band Negative I and was part of the release of its highly acclaimed 1st album “Reinvention” right after her single “Cold” as a solo artist on December 2010. She is currently performing as well as working on her next album to be release in 2014.</P>

<p>Additional tasks include: finding a way to put this in a publicly accessible Socrata community page AND our own site for more sandbox actions amongst those who desire to work on presentation of this data; a working demo for presentation to the public and Town Council(s). </p>

640,Data sig: The APPLY operator in SQL Srv - Kevin Feasel ,"<p>Abstract:</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced the APPLY operator in SQL Server 2005. This under-used, non-standard operator can help us solve a number of common (and not-so-common) problems with elegant code which performs well. We will look several problem spaces in which the APPLY operator shines, such as joining to table-valued functions, getting the top N child records for each parent record, string splitting, and word matching. With the use of these examples, we will gain a deeper understanding of when to use the APPLY operator.</p>
<p>Bio:</p>
<p>Kevin Feasel is a database administrator at American Health Holding, a subsidiary of Aetna, where he specializes in SSIS development, performance tuning, and pulling rabbits out of hats on demand. He is a contributing author to Tribal SQL (www.tribalsql.com). A resident of Durham, North Carolina, he can be found cycling the trails along the triangle whenever the weather's nice enough.</p>",2013-11-20,2013-10-31 09:02:00.710395,2013-10-31 09:02:00.710395,http://www.meetup.com/TRINUG/events/148159582/,Triangle .NET User Group,,

1082,Intro to User Experience (UX),"<p><i>This 3 part Intro to User Experience course runs on Wednesday evenings: February 26th, March 5th and March 12th. The class times go from 7:00pm to 9:00pm each evening.</i></p> <p><br/>At its core, User Experience (UX) is defined as how someone feels about using a product, system, or service. Regardless of what we’re designing--a website, an Android app, or a toaster--we all strive to make our designs useful, easy to use, and enjoyable to use. But how exactly do we make something useful, easy to use, and enjoyable? How do we know if the target audience is having a good or bad experience? This class will arm you with the essential tips to find those answers.</p> <p>This class is for anyone who makes (or wants to learn how to make) websites, mobile apps, or other software. If you’re a developer, a designer, a project manager, a content creator, or something else, you can integrate UX research and design into your practice.</p> <p>By the end of this class, you’ll also learn tips and techniques to address the following:</p> <p>•  Fundamental concepts of user experience design </p> <p>• How to find out who your users are</p> <p>• Creating user personas</p> <p>• Identifying usability problems and prioritizing solutions </p> <p>• How to design and run usability tests </p> <p>• Getting useful feedback from your users </p> <p>• Information Architecture and interaction design </p> <p>• Where UX fits with project management methodologies </p> <p>• And more!</p> <p>This is a hands on course which will give you actionable tools to get started with user experience in your work day!</p> <p><b>Your Teacher: Sarah Kahn, Senior UX Designer at Deutsche Bank</b></p> <p><br/><img src=""http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/5/d/4/600_323961972.jpeg"" /></p> <p>Sarah Kahn is a rogue librarian turned UX/UI developer.

1081,3 Things to do Now for Greater Business Value,"<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> This meeting will take the place of the normal March 4th meeting. There will be no March 4th meeting.</p> <p>Joe will introduce and talk about these three items:</p> <p>1. Cost-benefit analysis with BV Points and Story Points.</p> <p>This is a part of “Joe’s Agile Release Planning”.  I will talk about how I recommend doing BV Points. And then how to use them with Story Points.  </p> <p>2. Business Value Engineering.</p> <p>This idea is to map the process of doing “business value.”  And to identify the underlying assumptions or hypotheses.  Then fix the weakest piece.  Then do a BV Model.  Then measure, as we change things, whether BV improves (or not).</p> <p>3. The 80-20 Rule</p> <p>How to use the Pareto idea. The expectation is not that, the first time out, you will only do 20% of the work and achieve 80% of the business value.  And it certainly is limited, to some degree, by the Minimum Marketable Feature set requirements.  Still, we must say ‘no’ to more features in this release.</p> <p>These are ideas we work with with each Team’s real work almost every week.  We will give you, quickly, the benefit of our learning.</p> <p>We expect your questions, and will take time to answer them.  Each of these topics is actually quite involved, so this is an introductory conversation.    </p> <p>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE=""font-size: large;"">The Startup Endowment</SPAN></STRONG></P>
<P>We're no strangers to setting audacious goals.  Let's build an endowment that will benefit local charities for years to come.  We're both raising money and asking entrepreneurs to donate what they have to give: equity in their businesses.  Here are our goals:</P>
<UL>
<LI>$10,000 to open a charitable fund with the Triangle Communitiy Foundation.  And then,</LI>
<LI>$50,000 to endow the fund so that it will provide a reliable resource for area charities</LI>
</UL>
<P>The money is only the beginning.  We have the unique opportunity to donate a small fraction of the equity we each own in our businesses - say 1% of the shares we own personally - so that the vision we're working towards day and night can also accrue to the benefit of our community.  That gives us two additional goals:</P>
<UL>
<LI>100 entrepreneurs to pledge 1% of the equity they hold in their companies to our fund.  And then,</LI>
<LI>1000 entrepreneurs to pledge 1% of the equity they hold in their companies to our fund </LI>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE=""font-size: large;"">The Kickoff Event</SPAN></STRONG></P>
<P>As entrepreneurs we sometimes must choose between building our businesses and building our community.  Or even between spending time at events and spending time with our families.  The Giveback aims to combine all of these activities in one day of fun, with proceeds benefiting the Triangle Community foundation.  There will be a $10 suggested donation for free food, and local craft beer for a $5 suggested dontation.  100% of the gross proceeds will go directly to the fund.</P>",2013-11-16,2013-10-23 09:02:30.26928,2013-10-23 09:02:30.26928,http://startupgiveback-SRCH.eventbrite.com,Various sponsors,,

But single decision trees can overfit your data and give misleading results. How do you decide when the tree has enough ""branches""? Enter the random forest. Thanks to MetLife for generously providing the space for this event.</p> <p>After the meeting, join the group at MEZ Contemporary Mexican just across the street at 5410 Page Road.</p> <p>Thanks,<br/>Ian</p>",2014-03-20,2014-03-18 09:01:42.129764,2014-03-18 09:01:42.129764,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-useR/events/171751252/,Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill R Users Group,,

<p>Since many of us get to the meeting early, we will make a half-hour available as a meet-eat-and-greet time prior to any presentations or shop talk. We will continue to start formally at 7:30pm, but the time change is to reflect this chatting time.</p>
<p>Since we all usually chat as people arrive, we will not continue to do a round-robin greeting at 7:30pm. We will instead end the greeting period with announcements, and then give the floor to the presenter or moderator.</p>

668,Basic electronic soldering,"<p>Come to Splatspace and learn the basics of through-hole soldering.</p>
<p>There is no charge for the class, but you'll need something to practice on. You can buy many different kinds of electronics soldering kits at Radio Shack, or we have some other options:</p>
<p>We have three Solarbotics Ardweeny kits and two Modern Device's RBBB kits. These would be great to use if you want to get into Arduino or other microcontrollers. For future experimentation we have three Solarbotics Breadboard 5V power supply kits, very handy for prototyping.</p>
<p>We also have Brain Machine, Drawdio, and TVBGone kits from Adafruit. (One each.)</p>
<p>Any of the above kits will be available for list price, which you can easily look up. We also have a few Velleman electronics kits of various kinds, usually $10 to $15.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you don't want to buy any kit, we can scrounge up some random parts and boards so that you can just practice the skills of soldering without actually making anything to keep.</p>
<p>Adults and children 8+ (with supervising parent or guardian) are welcome.</p>",2013-11-10,2013-11-07 09:01:17.508148,2013-11-07 09:01:17.508148,http://www.meetup.com/splatspace/events/149577102/,Splat Space - Durham's Hackerspace,,

You're exactly who we want to teach.</p> <p>In this class, we will be covering: basic development concepts, JavaScript, dynamic HTML, and animations and events. Students will exit this class with a good grasp of basic programming principles and the knowledge of how to manipulate HTML elements. </p> <p>Prerequisites: We suggest having a working knowledge of HTML as a prerequisite for this course.

962,The Raleigh-Durham Web Design Group Monthly Meetup,"<p>With easily more than 50 <b>JavaScript charting libraries</b> out there, it can be confusing to pick the right one.  We'll look at some of the more prominent players in this space like Flot, jqPlot, Highcharts.js, Google Chart Tools, Chart.js.  The popular D3 is more of a graphics library and, as such, several charting libraries build on top of it.  When jQuery 2.0 dropped support for IE8 and earlier last year, it opened the door for us to sensibly target only those browsers which support Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and the HTML5 canvas element (with CSS3) and it is these technologies which underpin modern charting libraries. </p> <p>So, what are the differences between SVG and canvas as an implementer, and for the end user?  And what benefits are gained for the user (animations, hover effects, etc)?  What gets lost versus server-generated images (save the image or copy it into an email or document)?  We will actually look at some clever hacks that try to restore the ability to save rendered charts as an image, all executing client-side in the browser.</p> <p><br/><b>About the presenter:</b>  Ian Cillay has been developing Web applications since 1996, having spent most of these years working for design-centric agencies in London.  Since moving to the Triangle in 2007, he has become active in the open data and civic hacking movement, and is a member of Cary's Code for America brigade and co-founder of Triangle Open Data Day [<a href=""http://triangleopendataday.org/""><a href=""http://triangleopendataday.org"" class=""linkified"">http://triangleopendataday.org</a></a>], a free event for programmers, data analysts, web developers and designers, which will take place on February 22nd 2014.</p> <p><br/><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>Note About Meeting Times</b></p> <p>Since many of us get to the meeting early, we will make a half-hour available as a meet-eat-and-greet time prior to any presentations or shop talk. We will continue to start formally at 7:30pm, but the time change is to reflect this chatting time.</p> <p>Since we all usually chat as people arrive, we will not continue to do a round-robin greeting at 7:30pm. We will instead end the greeting period with announcements, and then give the floor to the presenter or moderator.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Please consider the benefits of moderating, presenting lecture style, or giving a tutorial:</p> <p>Enhanced Credibility</p> <p>Visibility For Your Business</p> <p>Increased Good Will</p> <p><br/>(Tentative speakers, THANK YOU for your participation.)<br/>Contact <a href=""mailto:[masked]"">Mitch</a> or Pepper to get on a meeting schedule!</p> <p> </p> <p><br/>We Thank Our Sponsors<br/><a href=""http://www.peppergraphics.com/"">PepperGraphics</a><br/><a href=""http://www.agilemarkup.com/"">Agile Markup Corporation</a></p> <p>

Kyle has found some info about mini-Drupal camp options (a great way to give it a try without all the infrastructure of a multi-day camp). Plus, there will likely be others there who have been involved in running a DrupalCamp at other locations.</p> <p>Please join us - it is a great way to network and enjoy the company of other Drupal-ites!</p> <p>And give a shout-out to Robert Petrusz at Bull City Coworking.

I have been traveling in Ecuador for the past two months and am returning to the United States tomorrow. I thought we might just take a break for one month and reconvene in February. That would give us time to plan for the next WordPress Chapel Hill, which I think is very important.</p> <p>The February WordPress Chapel Hill Meetup will focus on using Cart66 (&lt;a&gt;<a href=""http://www.cart66.com&lt;/a&gt"" class=""linkified"">http://www.cart66.com&lt;/a&gt</a>;) for Ecommerce and digital downloads.</p> <p>We will walk through set up, the use of shortcodes for products, how to sell digital downloads and discuss the different payment gateways using this very flexible e-commerce tool. And, we'll talk about how Cart66 has gone to the cloud and what the means for managing your e-commerce.</p> <p>We will also demo two websites from DSW clients using Cart66 for their e-commerce solutions.</p> <p>My goal is to ask Lee Blue, the owner of Cart66, to come down and talk to us about the plugin and share any useful tips. It will also be interesting to hear about how using Cart66 precludes you from having to purchase an SSL certification. I've asked Lee to come to present and am waiting for his reply. I'll update the Meetup notification when I get confirmation from Lee that he can make it.</p>",2014-02-17,2014-01-28 09:00:50.095381,2014-01-28 09:00:50.095381,http://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Chapel-Hill/events/162859682/,WordPress Chapel Hill,,
1146,Triangle Analysts Meetup: Community Detection with Lucia Gjeltema,"<p>Hi Triangle useRs,</p> <p>This month's Research Triangle Analysts meetup will be held this Thursday February 20 at 6:00pm at the Cameron Village Regional Library adjacent to the Cameron Village shopping center in Raleigh.</p> <p>Network graph analysis is a hot topic in social media, fraud detection, and academia. In many applications, networked individuals end up on one large ""clump"", making further analysis nearly impossible. Community detection is one way to break a huge graph into small meaningful groups for real-world analyses. We will introduce various structural definitions of graph communities and give an overview of algorithms that capture them. We'll conclude the presentation with a review of performance metrics that compare detected communities with ground-truth information.</p> <p>Please join us afterward at Cameron Bar and Grill (in Cameron Village)<br/>Cameron Bar and Grill<br/>2018 Clark Avenue<br/>Raleigh, NC 27605<br/><a href=""http://www.cameronbarandgrill.com/""><a href=""http://www.cameronbarandgrill.com/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.cameronbarandgrill.com/</a></a></p> <p>Please do not RSVP here.  To RSVP for this meetup, please join the Research Triangle Analysts meetup group and RSVP at <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Research-Triangle-Analysts/events/165595772/""><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/Research-Triangle-Analysts/events/165595772/"" class=""linkified"">http://www.meetup.com/Research-Triangle-Analysts/events/165595772/</a></p> <p></a>Thanks,</p> <p>Ian</p>",2014-02-20,2014-02-19 09:02:13.419165,2014-02-19 09:02:13.419165,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-useR/events/166908332/,Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill R Users Group,,

What about dealing with replicating databases? Do you ever wonder if there is a better way than just creating yet another table and updating all of your queries just because a relationship changed?</p> <p>NoSQL databases can help deal with these requirement issues and give you a more flexible and fast way to store and retrieve data. In this session, we'll look at how to understand NoSQL and ColdFusion. We'll relate common data access in SQL Databases to NoSQL formats. We'll also look at popular ways to integrate NoSQL databases into your ColdFusion applications.

1117,Power Blogging with WordPress,"<p>Each month, we talk about how to get the most out of WordPress and many times the discussion centers around the technical and not so much around its core feature and what Wordpress was built on - the blog!</p> <p>As WordPress has advanced, we use it for e-commerce, event systems, websites for professionals...you name it and someone is doing it in WordPress. But, like any good meetup group, we should definitely go back to the basics and talk about how to power blog with WordPress.</p> <p>Here's what we'll cover:</p> <p>1. The basics of data in WordPress.</p> <p>We'll go over Posts, Pages, Categories, Tags, Excerpts, Trackbacks, Featured Images, Permalinks, Tiny MCE and Comments and discuss why each of these elements in WordPress is important and what each element does for writing and managing your posts, as well as for SEO (search engine optimization).</p> <p>2. The WordPress Media Library</p> <p>The native Media Library in Wordpress has come a looooong way! Many of us used to use NextGen Gallery, but there is now little need to utilize a third party plugin when all the features you need are in the Media Library. We'll discuss how to get photos into WordPress, how to tag them with meta data and how to crop, resize, rotate or otherwise edit them and then insert them into your posts. We'll also discuss Featured Images and where and how some themes use Featured Images for posts and pages and what you need to know, so you're not confused as to why your post image you placed inside a post did not show up on the homepage and why your Featured Image is your primary image.</p> <p>3. Multimedia</p> <p>Text is awesome, but we're a visual society and people love photos and video. We'll talk about your options for video. From YouTube, Vimeo and Vine to more powerful solutions like Brightcove, Kaltura and others. Maybe your blog needs more video than photos and text. What about audio? SoundCloud is insanely popular, but publishing widgets in your WordPress is bad for SEO. Maybe you want to podcast and feature on iTunes. We'll discuss options.</p> <p>4. Advertising and Syndication</p> <p>Everyone wants to learn about making money online. While this session is NOT about making money, we'll introduce you to a couple of ways you can possibly make revenue with your website outside of selling products or services. There's Linkshare, Amazon Afffiliate and Google's Adsense to name a few. YouTube is offering its media creators a slice of the pie. And, there are other blog networks that are asking you to share your content for a share of ad dollars. We'll discuss what's out there and how you can benefit.</p> <p>6. Third party content and plugins</p> <p>Want to publish content from other sites or networks in your blog? Yes, there are now plugins that will auto-publish feeds from other sites into your blog. They'll take the excerpt and post title from the RSS feed or another website and create a post in your site. Do you need to grab Twitter, Facebook and YouTube videos and publish them in your site? With a plugin like Storify, you can build content using this tool on their site and then directly publish it into your own site. Want to spread your content around the web as related content on someone else's site? If so, then Outbrain might be for you. It publishes your blogs content within its network of blogs, so that it may be stumbled upon somewhere else and drive that visit back to your site. There are many options and we'll touch on just a few, given time limitations.</p> <p>Join us for the discussion! Bring yourself and your questions or your knowledge.</p>",2014-03-24,2014-02-18 03:29:23.711566,2014-02-18 03:29:23.711566,http://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Chapel-Hill/events/164294902/,WordPress Chapel Hill,,

I’ll explain what we use, what the setup is, and why a piece of infrastrucure is what it is. We use a combination of data stores from SQL to redis to elastic search to handle about 40 million page views a day and 4 billion hits a month. I’ll cover what’s in the data center, what’s in the web stack, and what examples of choices we make in our own software to keep page load times as low as possible. A lot of the things we do to stay fast end up as open-source, I’ll include a quick look at those projects as well. Q&amp;A is more than welcome, we’re pretty open about almost everything.</p> <p>Speaker:<br/>I’m <b>Nick Craver</b>, a software developer and systems administrator for Stack Exchange. I have been developing software for 14 years and have been building Stack Overflow for the last 3. I maintain our database and search systems, and help design and optimize most of our other systems to run faster and leaner so we can continue to scale.

<H4>Absent Boundaries</H4>
<P>Two long-time Geminis hone their efforts to make a modern progressive rock album start to finish with a maelstrom of influences. David Mills has studied Jazz, Blues, Classical, Prog. rock, as well as more eclectic musical styles and has transformed this amalgam through his compositions into a sophisticated expression that leaves one wanting more. Vocalist Ari Pappalardo always had a love affair with the emotive singing styles of various musicians throughout the 60's, 70's, and 90's. His brash application of a multi-range approach to vocal melody writing leaves a dynamic imprint on the audience. Together they traverse the musical universe Absent of Boundaries.</P>

<H4>Mills Rainey Jazz Duo</H4>
<P>Guitarist David Mills and tenor saxophonist Jesse Rainey met each other inside North Carolina Central University’s B.N. Duke auditorium in late October 2013. Jesse ventured onto campus in search of a serious musician to play with and noticed David quietly practicing a chord melody rendition of Antonio Carlos Jobim’s song “Wave”. The chords caught Jesse’s attention and he asked David if he knew another bossa nova song by Tony Hatch titled “Call Me”. They quickly began to perform it, instantly connected, and decided to start the duo on day one. Now the two live together in Durham, NC, and have been actively gigging in the Triangle area ever since. Believing in the importance of keeping the jazz tradition of “swing” alive, The Mills-Rainey Jazz Duo stays true to the roots of jazz, plays a variety of jazz standards, ballads, and blues and gives their all in each performance.</P>

1142,Augustines,"<H4>Augustines</H4>
<P>With its open-armed energy and elegiac grace, “AUGUSTINES” marks a colossal leap forward for Votiv/Oxcart recording group Augustines – no mean feat considering the extraordinary power of their breakthrough 2011 debut, “RISE YE SUNKEN SHIPS.” Songs like “Now You Are Free” and the plaintive “Walkabout” are both immediate and engaging, joining joyously unrestrained arrangements with singer/guitarist Billy McCarthy’s signature affective lyricism. “AUGUSTINES” marks a milestone on Augustines’ amazing journey, the work of a gifted band ascending to new heights while simultaneously grappling with their place in the universe.<BR> “You have to do some soul-searching when given the opportunity to manifest your dream,” McCarthy says. “You’re free to walk the walk you always said you could walk.”</P>
<P>“If you struggle for a period of time to get something, there’s obviously a feeling of pride that comes when you achieve it,” says co-founder/bassist Eric Sanderson. “It’s very freeing, but like with any kind of freedom, it comes with a sense of wonder and confusion.” Augustines was born upon the ashes of the Brooklyn indie rock band, Pela. That combo called an end to its collective trip in 2009, but founders McCarthy and Sanderson reunited to record a series of deeply personal songs chronicling despair, depression, and the untimely death of a close family member. They dubbed their intimate new endeavor, “Augustines,” which trademark issues required be appended to “We Are Augustines.” “The name ‘Augustines’ resonates for us in many regards,” Sanderson says. “The minute we gave the project a name is really when it birthed itself. To have that name taken away from us, or even modified in a minor way, was always difficult. Now we’ve come full circle.”<BR> “RISE YE SUNKEN SHIPS” – recorded and mixed by Dave Newfeld (Broken Social Scene, Super Furry Animals) – instantly set Augustines among modern music’s most compelling new bands. Songs like “Juarez” and “Book of James” touched a collective nerve, their dark subject matter refracted and then elevated by Augustines’ affirmative approach. Hailed by iTunes as 2011’s “Best Alternative Album,” “RISE YE SUNKEN SHIPS” was a critical and popular sensation, earning abundant praise and a fervent fan following. McCarthy and Sanderson enlisted the talents of British-born, conservatory-trained drummer Rob Allen and with that, Augustines became a fully-fledged band. The trio traveled the planet, performing innumerable headline shows, support sets, and show-stealing festival dates. “We went touring together for two and a half years,” Allen says, “ Over two hundred shows…You can imagine the kind of bond you get from going on the road like that. You become a family.”<BR> By the end, Augustines felt akin to Archibald MacNeal Willard’s “The Spirit of ’76,” bloodied but unbowed as they marched home from their long campaign. They paused to heal their dents and dings, with McCarthy embarking on an extended expedition that saw him visit such far-flung locales as Kenya, Turkey, Mexico, and Alaska. He eventually drifted back to the Applegate, California elementary school where he first learned an instrument. There he worked, observed by students and faculty as he put fingers on strings and pen to paper. “I wanted to go back to the most stripped down form,” he says, “to when and where music first touched me. It was very soothing, having been at this for 12 years, to limp back to this small town grade school.” Meanwhile, Sanderson and Allen worked on demos of their own, each still abuzz with ideas and experiences garnered on the infinite tour. In late November 2012, Augustines reconvened for a month of woodshedding at Temperamental Recordings, a converted 19th century country church in Geneseo, New York.“It was like a music factory,” Allen says. “You could just feel the creativity oozing. We’d been playing basically the same set for two years so it was just like an overflow of ideas, like lava from a volcano.”<BR> Fully armed, Augustines next headed to Bridgeport, Connecticut to record with co-producer Peter Katis at his residential Tarquin Studios. Katis (The National, Frightened Rabbit, Interpol, and – most importantly to Augustines – Jónsi) proved the ideal collaborator, helping focus the band’s driven pace and ample vision.<BR> “We needed to work with somebody that was mature and confident,” Sanderson says. “Peter is very regimented and organized. He’s level-headed and that helped us to be level-headed as well.”<BR> From the start, the sessions evinced a decidedly more optimistic point of view that the one which fired their heartrending debut, with songs like “Nothing To Lose But Your Head” and the buoyant “Kid, You’re On Your Own” lit by positive vibrations and striking confidence. “This was us moving on together,” Allen says. “It was wonderful to come through the other end and record a new record. It was a huge accomplishment and looks towards a brighter future for us all.” “The depth and the place the first record came from is not something that is repeatable,” says Sanderson. “It’s not something one would want to repeat. We did everything we could -- as artists, as men – to learn from that experience, to become better people and move on.” Where their first record was created in relative isolation, “AUGUSTINES” was made “with the awareness that we weren’t going to be alone anymore,” says McCarthy. “This is us handing it over to those people that sang our songs back to us all over the world.</P>
<P>“The first record was obviously very personal,” he says. “It was really for us in many ways. There was almost an exchange – we turned from the interior and started considering some of the breathtaking moments that happened to us on the road, in different countries.”<BR> Indeed, tracks like the thundering “Cruel City” and the album-closing “Hold Onto Anything” demonstrate a distinctly outward shift in sonic scope, interpolating the holistic experience of West African music into Augustines’ sweeping, multi-faceted sound. “It’s not musicians up on a pedestal,” Sanderson – who studied music in Ghana– says. “The audience is singing, the audience is dancing, they’re all making music together..” That's what we've been trying to do our whole lives as musicians, but only recently have we been able to embrace that."" “It’s all about being inclusive,” McCarthy says. “Interaction is the lifeblood of what we think music is.”</P>
<P>Now based in Seattle, Augustines are eager to bring their brilliant new album to a worldwide audience keen for their return. If “RISE YE SUNKEN SHIPS” provided much needed catharsis, “AUGUSTINES” now takes this very special band to an altogether new plane, transcendent and triumphant.</P>

<H4>Daniel Amedee</H4>
<P>Daniel Amedee is living proof that a musician can be from New Orleans, but not necessarily be of New Orleans, a distinction that courses through his quirky, eccentric songwriting style, informed by a haunting bluesy vocalese that scratches the soul somewhere between Tom Waits and Captain Beefheart, and certainly belies young Daniel’s 26 years. In fact, he’s been at it – writing and producing his own music (and getting by with a little help from his friends) since age 14. Which prompts the question: How and where did this unassuming bundle of talent come to be inhabited by the avant garde spirits of progressive rock and guerilla classical that suffuse his debut CD, Themes From (ExPat Records, 2011)? And what can we expect from its follow-up, Climbing, due for release in 2013?</P>
<P>For all its grand and storied heritage of America’s jazz, blues, rock ’n roll, Cajun, Zydeco, R&B, and hip-hop, the Crescent City can be a harsh and unforgiving mistress for a fledgling singer-songwriter-arranger whose music leans more towards the atmospherics of Billboard’s modern rock chart and U2. Throw in the Gulf’s annual barrage of natural disasters, with their withering effect on the psyche, and it makes for a musical sensibility that is more King Crimson than King Oliver, more Mars Volta than Mardi Gras.</P>
<P>“I never really got into the New Orleans blues jazz,” Daniel confides. “It never appealed to me. I was always interested in rock. I guess the whole club jazz thing never really appealed to me that much, the New Orleans music stuff. I don’t know why.” Could it have something to do with your Catholic school upbringing? “It could, but I wouldn’t attribute it to that. I respect the musicians and I appreciate the music, but I don’t want to play it.”</P>
<P>Daniel Amedee was born on December 31, 1986, in picturesque Lakeview, a neighbor¬hood abounding in churches and parochial schools. His father was an attorney who specialized in school board law and wildlife law, and occasionally worked on projects with the Army Corps of Engineers. Mom ran a trendy Italian leather goods shop and taught English at LSU. She set that aside to raise her only child, but Daniel does remember trips to Italy as a youngster. His parents listened to Dr. John (dad) and Sting (mom), “those are the two that I really remember, and Bruce Springsteen too, he was there.”</P>
<P>Daniel is fond of telling the story back when he was eight years old, attending his cousin’s wedding, where gospel-soul singer Marva Wright’s band was playing. Daniel was captivated by their performance. He went over to them during their breaks, at the “band table,” and no doubt his Saints bow tie broke the ice. Marva let him up onstage when the band started to play and Daniel sang into the saxophonist’s microphone. Later he collected all their autographs on slips of paper and business cards, including one that read, “To Daniel - Keep the music alive - Love, Marva.” It was one of many treasured childhood mementos that were lost in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.</P>
<P>In grammar school, Daniel sang in the St. Paul’s Episcopal School choir, and at Brother Martin High School he was in the drum line, run by renowned instructor Marty Hurley. “It was one of the biggest ones in the state,” Daniel recalls. “It was something like 15 snare drummers, 4 or 5 quad players, and then about 7 or 8 bass drums, and then a whole xylophone section, about 30 of us altogether. He had us tight.”</P>
<P>And what did you gain from that experience? “It taught me structure, how to play in time. I can play to a metronome like nobody’s business,” a useful skill when you’re recording your own demos in your own bedroom. “That was around the time in high school that I started playing bass and guitar, and then bass was my primary instrument, so I really got a foundation in the rhythm section and bass. And then as I learned to play guitar, I evolved more. I can do song structure and I can keep a solid rhythm.”</P>
<P>Green Day and Blink-182 were holding sway in the early 2000s when Daniel started his first band around age 16, called Silent Game, in which he played bass. He taught himself to play power chords on guitar by using Blink-182 tab books, those same books destroyed by Katrina.</P>
<P>Inevitably, it all comes back to Katrina. Daniel graduated high school that year, 2005, and after getting a name for themselves in New Orleans, the guys in Silent Game got their parents’ permissions to go on a road tour. “We were kids, but we went from New Orleans and then to Mississippi, North Carolina, I know we got all the way up to Pittsburgh. Then we went over to Ohio, had a gig in Chicago, and then we came back down. It was about two and a half, three weeks.” Shows were booked in advance, including one in Pancake, Pennsylvania at a roller rink. “I think there were two people there. But you gotta do it. It was so much fun.”</P>
<P>Daniel was enrolled at UNO (and living with his folks) when they evacuated their house prior to Katrina making landfall on August 29th. All the band equipment was destroyed under nine feet of water, except for Daniel’s guitar and bass. He had already brought the instruments with him to Baton Rouge, where the family was taken in by relatives. That turned into a two year stay, during which Daniel took online courses at UNO, and eventually transferred to LSU.</P>
<P>The band gradually acquired new gear and determinedly set out on another tour in 2006, the same year that Daniel began actively writing and recording his original songs. His bedroom became his recording studio, working with Logic Express software, a Shure SM58 microphone, and a Line 6 TonePort interface that plugged directly into his black Mac Book. Under the band name Themes From…, Daniel completed a mini-album called Pages From Chaos. In its seven angry, introspective tracks, the music reflected the huge displacement in his life that Katrina had wrought.</P>
<P>The band, of course, was not interested in Daniel’s material because it was far from their pop punk mainstream. Now, the handwriting was on the wall. Daniel’s personality was beginning to change and he soon departed Silent Game (who are still going strong today in New Orleans, by the way).</P>
<P>By 2007, Daniel had acquired his first manager. Later in 2008, Daniel met a new friend and made plans to stay at his house in Ireland, in Clonmel, County Tipperary. The manager thought that was a good idea, that Ireland could be the base from which Daniel could play shows and develop a following in the more progressive markets of Europe.</P>
<P>Clonmel, frankly, turned out to be “pretty…boring,” so Daniel’s friend brought him to Cork City for a visit. The first pub they stopped in, they met Colm O’ Herlihy who, with his brother Shane, fronted the well-known Cork band, Remma, signed to Morrissey’s Attack Records label. An immediate friendship was struck, and it wasn’t long before Daniel became Remma’s new bass player, a gig he held for the next two and a half years.</P>
<P>Now Remma had been around for six years without making a full-length record, “and it was crazy to me. I never understood that. I was in the band for two and a half years and we only wrote two songs. They had a very snail pace about doing things.” Part of that was attributed to the lead singer, who had kidney failure in 2004, went on dialysis, had a kidney transplant, and was never the same again. By 2010, the band, especially Daniel, knew they had to record their first album if they were serious about going anywhere as musicians. As it happened, they were able to take advantage of their connection with guitarist Noel Hogan (of the Cranberries), who was itching to become a producer at his home studio.</P>
<P>“We would show up and he would be with his kids or running errands, doing normal people things,” Daniel told blogsite The Mic in 2011. “Then we'd start recording and come lunch time his wife would have sandwiches for us. It was a surreal and incredible experience. He and his family were some of the nicest and most hospitable people I've ever met.”</P>
<P>Remma completed a 5-song EP that was released through NorthStar Music Publishing of London. The band then decided they wanted to tour the States. It turned into quite a journey that summer, 2010: “It started in New Orleans, we went to Texas, New Mexico, up to Colorado, Seattle, down to San Francisco, L.A., San Diego, Arizona, back to New Mexico, back to Texas, then New Orleans. Then we took a two week break, and went up the East Coast to New York and back to New Orleans. It was a long tour. And I was the only one with the driver’s license. So I drove the entire thing. It was like 16,000 miles.”</P>
<P>In San Francisco, a friend took the band to Revolution Café where Daniel met Charles Gonzales, “who is originally a bass player and he’s originally from New Orleans. And he’s a producer. He and I just hit it off immediately. He took us back to the studio to record a song there with Remma.” Back across the country in Williamsburg (Brooklyn), Daniel broke the news to Remma that he was quits. With the band in tow, “I drove from New York to New Orleans nonstop, 24 hours straight. The tour was really hard for me but I learned a lot about what I did and didn’t want out of life. At that point I knew I had to move forward on my own.”</P>
<P>On November 1st, Daniel was back in San Francisco to begin recording his first album with Gonzales. Drummer Patrick Spurgeon (of Rogue Wave) was onboard, a phenomenally accomplished musician in his own right. String arrangements were played by Charith Premawardhana, known for his work on the Mars Volta’s breakthrough album, The Bedlam In Goliath, and as the founder of the Classical Revolution underground chamber music movement.</P>
<P>This time around, Themes From was the album title, under Daniel Amedee’s name. Available at CD Baby, iTunes, and SoundCloud.com, the album built a small but elite following, and a video was produced for track two, the five minute “Swimming Through the Unconscious Disconscience.” Another track was given away for free, “Solution.” The Poule d’Or website called the album “beautifully dreamy, very well produced and overall pretty enjoyable! A fitting warm summer evening soundtrack.”</P>
<P>Flick-Thru.com, wrote: “Daniel Amedee is a singer songwriter who demonstrates a real knack for writing gorgeous cinematic choral pieces, like ‘Home And Heartfelt.’ When he sings, his voice sits really quite uncertainly between an indie kid and Tom Waits, so much so that it could be two different people. However here we have luscious harmonic writing that I found really rather affecting.” A live session was also released over the web, containing five songs off Themes From and unexpected covers of Neil Young’s “Heart Of Gold” and Bob Dylan’s “Its All Over Now, Baby Blue.” Go to: <A HREF=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Ztml21qIA"" REL=""nofollow nofollow"" TARGET=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Ztml21qIA</A></P>
<P>Currently making the rounds is a one-off single that Daniel recorded at the suggestion of his [new] manager, Michael Pillot, the record industry veteran who also manages Louisiana’s premiere Cajun band, BeauSoleil. “Christmas In The City Of Love” is part fever dream, part automatic composing, and part subversive Christmas song: “There’s love in the streets of New Orleans/ There’s love in the streets of Berlin. . . It’s Christmas in the city of love/ You can feel it in the hearts of everyone.”</P>
<P>“To me it’s more than a Christmas song,” Daniel says. “It’s more about the feeling of warmth and love that you feel towards your family and that you feel towards others, setting aside the materialistic side of Christmas. The idea of getting together and sharing this life and just giving, giving love to people, that’s really what the song is about.” The track is up for sale at CD Baby, iTunes, Amazon, all the usual suspects.</P>
<P>What does the immediate future have in store for Daniel Amedee? Leading up to the release of his second album, Climbing in 2013 (also produced by Charles Gonzales and featuring Patrick Spurgeon on drums) – more videos, more interaction with social media, more recordings, more collaborations. When asked by The Mic what got him started in this business, the answer poured out: “My own persistence and belief that I could write songs and make it in this industry would be the round about answer. But I played with many different people before I realized I was what I needed to succeed and the right people would come to me instead of vice versa. I never stopped writing my own songs and privately developing my own style while playing with other people, and when the opportunity came to take a step forward and record my first full length album I took it.”</P>

732,Software Craftsmanship: Paying Attention to Quality,"<p><b>Talk Summary</b></p>
<p>Some people seem to think that being a rock star programmer is about how many projects you participate in on github or how many follow you on twitter.  But, the reality is that the quality of a Software Craftsman can be found in the work he produces.  How do you get that quality up there, consistently keep it there, and keep raising the bar?  Through a combination of some discussion on the nature of Skills Acquisition, and an analysis of common practices in software development (from Tests to Pull Requests to Pair Programming), we'll paint a picture of how to become a true expert.</p>
<p><b>About Ken Auer</b></p>
<p><i>Ken Auer was introduced as the father of Software Craftsmanship at the first Software Craftsmanship North America (SCNA) conference. Whether or not that is merited, he has always taken pride in his craft. He was one of the early pioneers of using Object-Oriented Programming in real world, commercial applications in the mid-80s, pioneered immersion-level apprentice programs in the early 90s, as well as Patterns, XP, and studio style development when he founded RoleModel Software in 1997. He believes that Software Craftsmen ship (rather than just blog and tweet about it), and lives to build high-performance teams that turn his clients' concepts into reality.</i></p>",2013-12-11,2013-11-27 09:02:47.502953,2013-11-27 09:02:47.502953,http://www.meetup.com/raleighrb/events/152811412/,The Triangle Ruby Brigade (Triangle.rb),,

<H4>Adam Lane & Jeff Mullins</H4>
<P>Adam Lane began writing songs on acoustic guitar while studying in Oxford, England during the summer of 1995. Once back in Chapel Hill, NC, he quickly recorded Six from the Ground Up, a six song EP Cassette recorded under the moniker The Casey Andrews Project. In the late ‘90s, Adam played acoustic shows in the Chapel Hill area, as well as Zakk’s Coffeehouse in Murfreesboro, NC, and Swampfest in his home town of Gatesville, NC. Adam played Swampfest annually from 1995 to 1999, the last three with his friend, musician Jeff Mullins, who often accompanied Adam on acoustic lead guitar and backing vocals.</P>
<P>Adam’s first band experience was as a drummer. He played drums toward the end of high school in his hometown of Gates County, NC, with The Cagebirds and later in college for Gates County alternative band Fathm.</P>
<P>After living in Charlotte for a few years, Adam moved back to Raleigh, NC, in 1999 and formed the band Brothers Grim. The lineup included Adam, the primary songwriter, on lead vocals and rhythm guitar; Jeff Mullins on lead guitar; Jamie Dawson on bass guitar; and Shimer Gradus on drums. Brothers Grim’s first show was September 16, 2000, at Boo’s Hideaway in Raleigh, and the final show with the original lineup was November 9, 2001, opening for Raleigh’s Patty Hurst Shifter at Humble Pie.</P>
<P>After playing under a couple of other names, Brothers Grim was eventually reformed with Adam, Jamie, Shimer, and new guitarist Kris Walz. Gill Langston (Better Times, Between the Gears) played in different incarnations of the band, and J. Scott Gilmore (Local Folk, Needham’s Neighbor) was added in 2007 as a second lead guitarist and lap steel. The second running of Brothers Grim played its last show September 7, 2007, at The Flipside in Clayton, NC.</P>
<P>Brothers Grim played over 70 shows from 2000 to 2007 while bringing their own brand of underground rock and twang to clubs and venues from Raleigh to Chapel Hill, NC, and points beyond. The band was known for its explosive and unpredictable live shows, and the music was hailed for being distinct and diverse as the band moved through sets ranging from original alt country ballads to full throttle rock and back again.</P>
<P>In 2004 Brothers Grim contributed their cover of “Cedartown, Georgia” for the Waylon Jennings tribute album Hoss, and was among the performers at the Hoss CD release party in Raleigh at the Pour House Music Hall June 20, 2004. The event, sponsored by Triangle-based music discussion group Guitartown, was a benefit for Hospice of Wake County. Brothers Grim also opened the Guitartown Holiday Benefit at the Pour House on December 18 of that same year.</P>
<P>In 2005 Brothers Grim released their 6 song EP Bury Me in the Swamp. The EP was nominated in the local Indy Music Awards for Best Country Record and Best Country Song for “You’re Killing Me.” The album was engineered by Gill Langston.</P>
<P>After winning the most online votes in a local band contest, Brothers Grim was the opening band for Raleigh Downtown Live on August 27, 2005. Along with other regional bands they opened for national acts Seven Mary Three and Naughty by Nature.</P>
<P>The bluegrass band Kickin’ Grass has recorded two of Lane’s songs, “Hello It’s Me” for the 2006 album On the Short Rows and “The Filling Station” (original title “Exxon”) on the band’s 2012 release Walk With Me. ""The Filling Station"" also appears on Kickin' Grass' 2013 release Live at the Carolina Theatre.</P>
<P>Post Brothers Grim, Adam played a couple of solo shows at Raleigh’s Sadlack’s Heroes, notably December 10, 2010, opening for Colin Gawel of Watershed.</P>
<P>Adam and friend Harris Hollingsworth jammed for a couple of years with different drummers and bass players including drummer Tom Scheft from late ‘60s garage band, The Rising Storm. With Adam on vocals and Harris on guitar, the band played loud guitar rock drawing on personal favorites including songs by Urge Overkill, Superdrag, and Iggy Pop. Dubbed The Alias Invasion, the band played one show on February 4, 2011, opening for Skullbuckle at their CD release show.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV>Currently Adam Lane is writing new music as well as playing older acoustic favorites with longtime friend and Brothers Grim original, Jeff Mullins. The reunion began with the pair opening for Kickin’ Grass’ Eastern North Carolina CD Release show for Walk with Me in New Bern, NC, July 27, 2012. Subsequently Adam and Jeff opened the Guitartown Hopscotch Kick-off Party at Sadlack’s on September 6, 2012.

<p>WHAT: TA3M in Durham [1,2] <br />

WHEN: Monday November 18th from 7pm 'till 9pm <br />

TOPIC: The Challenge of Archiving Dynamic Websites at ibiblio</p>
<p>TA3M is explicitly informal and open. You're invited to hack the process, ask questions, and be critical. You are very welcome to join in if you have something you want to share or discuss.</p>
<p>This month's presentation is on ibiblio [4], and the challenge of archiving dynamic websites. ibiblio is the Public's Library and Digital Archive. It hosts a range of collections across many disciplines. Their core task -- providing infrastructure for digital collection development and preservation of digital content -- has gotten more challenging over time. Sites made before roughly 1997 are relatively easy to archive. With a few exceptions (RIP blink tag), they render today just like they did in 1997, and the only concerns of the archivist are those of the underlying media: flipped bits or crashed disk heads, for example. This talk will give a brief introduction to archiving digital content and will then explore more complex archiving problems faced today. We'll close with a call to action and discussion of how the challenges of archiving dynamic websites might be overcome.</p>
<p>Our presenter is Cristóbal Palmer [5], the technical director of ibiblio.org, and an advocate for Free and Open Source Software.</p>
<p>RSVP optional.</p>

<p>Here's a description of the talk series [5]: ""Please join the Software Freedom Law Center and Columbia Law School for a series of talks by Eben Moglen that will address the following questions: <br />

 * What has Edward Snowden done to change the course of human history? <br />

 * How does the evolution of surveillance since World War II threaten democracy? <br />

 * What does it mean that information can be both so powerful and so easily spread? In a network embracing all of humanity, how does democracy survive our desire for security?""</p>
<p>We'll meet to watch the live stream and then find somewhere nearby to get some food and/or a drink, and discuss the talk.</p>

<p>The Wednesday, December 18th meetup at Bronto is going to be more relaxed, as we socialize and have lightning talks given by you. If you're unfamiliar, a lightning talk is a brief talk lasting up to five minutes where you talk on any topic that interests you and that you think is relevant to the group. This can be on a technology you're using, a process you find helpful, an awesome book you've read, a hard problem, testing, company culture, etc. It's wide open.</p>
<p>If you'd like to give a lightning talk, sign up <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/opscode.com/forms/d/1rm80QsWuOVehHKNGyJprbbDTzKdQTWOXBlAkJ15_kdg/viewform"">here</a>. You can use slides, you can demo live, or you can just speak to the room. The format is open. If inspiration strikes you at the last moment and you opt to speak five minutes before the meetup, that's not a problem. Just let an organizer know and we'll work you in. The goal of the signup sheet is to help us organize, but advanced signup is not required.</p>
<p>There will be pizza, sodas, and beer to go with plenty of socializing and idea exchanging. So come out and let's have one last great meetup before the calendar changes to the new year.</p>

The first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which will likely be the dominant cryptocurrency being traded at each meetup (though all cryptocurrencies are welcome). Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>Ground rules:<br/>1. No force.<br/>2. No fraud.<br/>3. No coercion.<br/>4. Have fun!</p> <p>We meet right in the middle of Nash Square, next to the Fallen Fire Fighters Memorial.  During the winter, when it is cold and dark, we may wander over to the Brewmasters reasturant rather quickly.  Brewmasters across the street from the south west corner of Nash Square.</p>",2014-01-30,2014-01-30 09:00:25.911796,2014-01-30 09:00:25.911796,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/162396552/,Triangle Bitcoin Meetup,,

580,Triangle Analysts Meetup: Big Data Science with Dahl Winters,"<p>Hi Triangle useRs, <br />

<span> <br />

This month's Research Triangle Analysts meetup will be on Thursday, October 17 at 6:30pm at  <br />

</span><span>Buffalo Brothers <br />

4025 Lake Boone Trail <br />

Suite #100 <br />

Raleigh, NC <br />

<a href=""http://www.buffbrothers.com/locations/lake-boone-trail.html"">http://www.buffbrothers.com/locations/lake-boone-trail.html</a> <br />

</span><span> <br />

Description of the meetup:</span><span> <br />

</span><span> <br />

In this whirlwind hour Dahl Winters will attempt to blaze a trail through the wilderness that is big data science.  Given a mountain of unstructured data and the jungle of options in the Hadoop ecosystem, it can be difficult to know which tools to use for which investigations.  We will take a guided tour of the most common Hadoop use cases, peer into NoSQL and graph databases, march over to machine learning, avoid sinking into deep learning, and cover some of the classification and clustering algorithms I've worked with in my big data explorations.  If you can survive this hour unscathed, you will be that much more prepared to tackle your own big data mountain. <br />

</span><span> <br />

Thanks, <br />

<H4>Gainsay</H4>
<P>Gainsay is a post hardcore, indie rock band based in Durham, NC. The band started as a conversation by former bandmates Ryan McKellar (Bobby's Fever, Saints Will Do, Autocade) and Dante Bruno (Saints Will Do, A Grand Social Club, The Moments After). Joe Margiotta (Radio Island, Deep Six) became part of the conversation soon after, and the 3 piece became a band. Influenced by bands like Black Flag, Fugazi, Descendants, Dinosaur Jr., Avail, Superchunk, SDRE, Jawbreaker, among others, Gainsay speaks a new, old school sound that's all their own.</P>

<p>7:00 - 8:00PM - quick presentations on people's ongoing projects.</p>
<p>Presentations should take a maximum of ten minutes and should answer three principal questions: What did you do? How did you do it? What did you learn? A good rule of thumb is to cover include 6-8 slides. Please send the slides/topics to me in advance in and I will add your information and topic of discussion to the meetup description so that other people can come to hear you speak. You can alert me to your interests in presenting in your event RSVP or via email jason.t.james at gmail dot com.</p>

<DIV>
<P>PALEFACE is an American musician and artist, currently ontour as high-energy Ameriana three piece band, in supportof his Ramseur Records full-length, One Big Party. The band celebrated the release with a special guest- performance alongside The Avett Brothers at NYC’s Radio City Music Hall, followed by US and Europe tours. Soon after the album's release, Daytrotter.com featured a brand new live stripped down recording session by Paleface, and one of the tracks was voted ""Daytrotter's Best of the Year - Reader's Choice"". And later PASTE Magazine premiered ""PALEFACE - The Making of 'One Big Party'” a short docu- mentary which follows Paleface during the process of record- ing, touring and performing, and features interviews with Paleface, his darling drummer Mo Samalot, and Scott Avett of The Avett Brothers.</P>
<P>Paleface was first schooled musically by friend Daniel John-<BR> ston and soon discovered by the legendary Danny Fields (The Stooges, The Ramones, MC5) at an NYC open mic. He has since released over a dozen records including two major label releases, and he's collaborated and performed on three albums by The Avett Brothers. Paleface has influenced and inspired a wide range of musical acts, from indie electropopsters YACHT, to Grammy Award recipient Beck who calls Paleface “a big influence on my early work” on Annie Leibovitz’s book American Music. At the moment, Paleface is in the process of writing a new album to record later in the year.</P>

<H4>Jkutchma and the 5 Fifths</H4>
<DIV>
<P>Somewhere between Elvis Presley’s honorable discharge and his immediate sequestration under Colonel Parker’s fleshy, bejeweled wing, there existed a window of opportunity. What if, instead of “Paradise, Hawaiian Style,” we’d heard a deeper exploration of country and gospel music; what if he’d been backed by the Funk Brothers or the Wrecking Crew; what if Americana hadn’t come to mean either at best a rote recitation of Old Time music or at worst a bland, formulaic, slightly twangy version of Adult Contemporary? What if songs of genuine yearning, resolve, pain, and triumph drew in equal measure from both Hank Williams’ high lonesome and D. Boon’s credo, “Punk is whatever we made it to be.”?</P>
<P>J Kutchma and the Five Fifths are interested in trying to find out what that could sound like. This is, of course, not to say that the band bears any resemblance to the rhythm section/force of nature behind Motown’s hits or the greatest punk rock trio ever to climb in a van, only that the urgency with which they played, the trust they had in their bandmates, and the willingness to stumble upon How A Song Should Sound, to tear up the chart and start over—these are the hardest and best parts of playing music, and they’re the whole reason these five got together in the first place.</P>

1430,Triangle Maker Start-up Weekend,"<p>Well now is the time to get those hands dirty! Triangle Maker Startup Weekend 2014 is proud to present one of the first maker startup weekends on the east coast. All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: anyone is welcome to pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams organically form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and then it’s a 54 hour frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing, and market validation. The weekends culminate with presentations in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback.</p> <p>STUDENT DISCOUNT AVAILABLE <br/>VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</p> <p>Detailed Information + VIDEO!!! @</p> <p><a href=""http://trianglemaker.startupweekend.org/"" class=""linkified"">http://trianglemaker.startupweekend.org/</a></p> <p>Support Us by Tweeting about Us.</p>",2014-04-04,2014-03-28 16:32:53.045001,2014-03-28 16:33:52.719532,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Tech/events/168590492/,Triangle Tech Meetup,0,168590492
1431,WordPress and Version Control,"<p>Most people get started with WordPress by installing the system on their own servers as a hosting provider and either put the site in maintenance mode while they work on improvements or try to move a site from one folder to another after making those changes. This is why we have version control, but that's hard to understand for most people. Today, there are some systems that are making it easier for you or I to preview our sites before we deploy the changes to our live, public facing site. In this session, we'll learn a little about version control, how it works, why it's important and what are the things you need to know to be successful with this concept.</p> <p>If you have experience with version control and want to present on this subject, we welcome your submission. Please get in touch with me through the Meetup and we'll discuss your presentation to the group.</p>",2014-04-05,2014-03-28 16:32:53.054097,2014-03-28 16:33:52.734982,http://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Chapel-Hill/events/171991312/,WordPress Chapel Hill,0,171991312

Tony will introduce the basics concepts of WordPress and answer common questions, including:</p> <p><br/>• What is WordPress and what does WordPress actually do?</p> <p>• I'm not a developer, so how can I use WordPress to power my website or blog without any design or development experience?</p> <p>• I've been told to install WordPress on a hosting account (server). I don't have one of those, so how can I use WordPress without one?</p> <p>• I've never used Wordpress before and am not sure how to publish my content? What do I do first?</p> <p>• I've heard about SEO (search engine optimization), but I'm not sure why that's important or how to write for SEO?</p> <p>• I want to know how many people read my blog, but I'm not sure where to look?</p> <p>• I want to become a designer or developer, but am not sure where to get started.</p> <p>• I read a blogs on a mobile device (and/or) tablet.

The library has public wifi, so not to worry, you can connect to the Internet!</p> <p><b>Cost:</b></p> <p>This class is FREE!

1435,A Brief History of Laravel,"<p>Laravel is relatively new, but in its short lifespan it has already reached version 4.0 and amassed a large following in the PHP community. In this session we'll walk through the history of Laravel to understand why Laravel is structured the way it is today. Along the way we'll touch on how precursors like CodeIgniter and FuelPHP shaped Laravel, as well as how Laravel's adoption of composer in version 4.0 has changed the framework. We'll also get an overview of some basic Laravel concepts.</p> <p><br/>This will also be the first Triangle Laravel meetup! We'll be learning about the history of Laravel, but we'll also be discussing this meetup group - what you want to see covered, ideas for future meetups, and more.

1437,The Raleigh-Durham Web Design Group Monthly Meetup,"<p><b>Javascript and HTML5 animation, The Physics of Fun</b></p> <p>Instead of making this a presentation or lecture based get-together, I am instead hoping to have a forum or Q &amp; A-based session in which the audience openly engages in the topic of discussion.</p> <p>I will start with a very brief introduction into what animation actually is and display how we can apply it into web pages using the HTML5 canvas. The opening examples will be very simple and brief as they are only meant to show exactly what animation is.</p> <p>Then, the discussion will get a little more interactive and show how the elements on the screen can interact with the user through either screen events or keyboard interaction. Following the simplicity of adding user interaction, the talk will move on to show how easy it is to make visual representations of data and an introduction to making games with the canvas.</p> <p>There are 2 themes:</p> <p>The first is that there is very little external help required as far as importing 3rd party libraries and/or frameworks. I understand why people use them but I try to stay away from them any time I can.</p> <p>The second theme is that with a little practice, working with animation will make a designer/developer more proficient with javascript, better at coding in general, and most importantly this will make an individual stronger with mathematical concepts.</p> <p>So much of what we do in the computer world revolves entirely around a computer making multiple calculations per second. While there is no way that we can ever produce the same amount of computation, animation concepts are a universal key to helping us with better design/development strategy for future projects.</p> <p>Audience participation and discussion is the program for the evening, moderated by <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/WebDesign2-0/members/60004222/?a=mm1_l3"">Michael Karavan</a>.</p> <p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>Want to speak? Just contact any organizer or assistant organizer - Pepper, Dieter, Michael, or Mitch!</p> <p><b>Please consider moderating a meeting!</b> It takes only a small amount of preparation and the back-and-forth discussion is much more lively than a Q&amp;A session after a ""powerpoint and bullets"" lecture style presentation.</p> <p>We often have Open Floor discussions on topics chosen by a volunteer moderator. Some tickler topics:</p> <p>Building skills, or, what new software/services have you learned (or written!)</p> <p>Tips and Techniques for effective design by newbies</p> <p>Web SEO, marketing and evaluating results</p> <p>Book or article reviews - read or written!</p> <p>Focus Group style Web Site Tear Downs</p> <p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p> <p><b>Format of Meeting, and Time</b></p> <p>Please arrive before 7pm as the downastairs doors are locked at that time in this office building. You will need to call or text one of the organizers for us to come downstiars and let you in after 7pm.</p> <p>We typically do a round-robin greeting just before the action starts after enjoying some pizza provided by our hosting location TekSystems. We will end the greeting period with announcements, and then give the floor to the presenter or moderator.</p> <p> </p> <p>

We all want to accomplish something greater in our lives and become better people, but we tend to give up and lose the fight; because we aren't prepared. We mean well when we want to set goals, but the sad sad reality is we rob ourselves of living a better life that we visioned having.</P>

1163,Web/Mobile Apps sig: Node.js - Derik Whittaker,"<p>In the not too distant past JavaScript development was not only hard and time consuming but we could only execute our javascript in the browser on the client side.  However, in today's world JavaScript tooling is top notch, JavaScript development is very easy and most importantly we can run JavaScript anywhere.</p>
<p>In this session we will learn how to use <strong>NodeJs</strong> to build a server side JavaScript application.  We will learn how to harness the power of Node's Event-driven, non-IO blocking runtime to build a real time event messaging system.  By the end of this session you will understand how to download, install and configure Node along with how to utilize Node to build a server side messaging system written in JavaScript.</p>
<p>This will be a demo heavy session with very little slides so be prepared to get your code on.</p>

Some tickler topics:</p> <p>Building skills, or, what new software/services have you learned (or written!)</p> <p>Tips and Techniques for effective design by newbies</p> <p>Web SEO, marketing and evaluating results</p> <p>Book or article reviews - read or written!</p> <p>Focus Group style Web Site Tear Downs</p> <p>- Mitch</p> <p> </p> <p><b>Format of Meeting, and Time</b></p> <p>Since many of us get to the meeting early, we make a half-hour available as a meet-eat-and-greet time prior to any presentations or shop talk.

1489,Cainine Heart Sounds,"<H4>Cainine Heart Sounds</H4>
<P>n this essay I would like to talk about Canine Heart Sounds. I am going to talk about their influences in the 1st body paragraph. In the second paragraph I will talk about their music. In the last body paragraph I will talk about the future. In the conclusion I will condense and reflect upon the previous information without adding any new information here is the first paragraph. <BR> <BR> Canine Heart Sounds is a music-type group of the band genre. They spent time when they were younger practicing instruments. ""After they listened to other bands this gave them the idea that they should play music as well"" (Sounds of a Dog Heart: Official Canine Heart Sounds Story). Then they all joined together, as musicians. ""Before that they were friends. They joined as a band in eau claire ""(Cool K9z: The Totally Unauthorized CHS biography, pg 8-192). Then they moved/switched around and then they rejoined as a band in Duluth, MN. <BR> <BR> ""When they first started playing shows people would get their names wrong because their ears and brains spent more time correctly processing other information that was more important to them at the time"" (Mueller & Halviolentson, Data Functioning Processes in the Lower Cerebral Cortex, pg 7-5). One time they were called K9 Heat Sounds, another time they were called Canine Hearts, also they were called Canine Heart Sons, ,"" also several times their name had the acronym K9 instead of the full word ""Canine"" (Webster's Hip Hop Dictionary, pg iix-epilogue). <BR> <BR> Canine Heart Sounds main influences are non-musical. Nobody really knows what influences Zach and the two Matts. Dan however has gone on record about his affinity for Gary Paulsen novels, and he even likes Brian's Winter which was a slap in the face to all of those who enjoyed Hatchet, because it speculates on what would have happened if the young Brian would have to endure the harsh winter in the wilderness instead of being saved when he found the emergency transmitter.<BR> <BR> So in summation and conclusion, Canine Heart Sounds is truly a testament to the continuing spirit of Manifest Destiny and the Magna Carta that made it all possible. You've seen how their discovery of bronze (also known as maize) enabled their conquest of the corrupt Tammany Hall which dissapeared along with Roanoke Island (the first wooden submarine) many unimportant years ago. All in all, the spirit of Canine Heart Sounds will be here in the future, in the name of freedom and in the laughter of the dead. I would like to end this essay with a poem from T.S. Oscar Walden Emerson Thoreau: .. Give me a good dog .. With teeth and a tail .. Just give me twelve solid minutes with him..</P>

Joe Margiotta (Radio Island, Deep Six) became part of the conversation soon after, and the 3 piece became a band. Influenced by bands like Black Flag, Fugazi, Descendants, Dinosaur Jr., Avail, Superchunk, SDRE, Jawbreaker, among others, Gainsay speaks a new, old school sound that's all their own.</P>

1491,Natalie York,"<P><STRONG>Natalie York<BR> </STRONG></P>
<P>Critically acclaimed singer-songwriter Natalie York had a seismic artistic epiphany making her latest album, Promises. Previously, the Brooklyn-based artist garnered accolades for her quiet-fire aesthetic, a mix of contemporary folk and simmering Stax soul. But, for her sophomore record, she decided to do something bold – Natalie decided to make a rock record filtered through her distinct Americana vision.</P>
<P>Natalie grew up in the Washington DC area, and established herself in the local scene. She’s been covered by such respected media outlets asThe Washington Post, DC Music Download, and Washingtonian Magazine.The Washington Post has called Natalie’s debut: “One of the best local releases of 2010,” and praised her “soulful and warm vocals” and “sophisticated palette.” Natalie has earned favorable comparisons to Grace Potter, Norah Jones, and Bonnie Raitt. She studied jazz at the University of Miami, and was the first graduate from the distinguished institution’s Bruce Hornsby Creative American Music Program. In addition to press plaudits and academic accomplisments, Natalie has established a highly credible artist profile through performing and working with such diverse talents as Jonny Lang, Bruce Hornsby, Shawn Colvin, Lamont Dozier, Jim Lauderdale, Jon Secada, and Phil Ramone.</P>
<P>Initially, the plan for her follow-up album was to record in a church, with acoustic instrumentation and one microphone in order to distill her smoldering Americana down to its bare essentials. But, she realized, that approach wouldn’t be authentic to her artistic journey—that approach would only represent half of the inspiration equation. It would capture the spirit of formative influences like Dinah Washington, Karen Dalton, and Ralph Stanley, but it wouldn’t capture her love of brasher artists like Wilson Pickett and AC/DC. One night at a bar, producer/indie rock singer-songwriter Russ Flynn overheard Natalie discussing this quandary with friends and offered to produce her. “I never thought he’d follow up,” Natalie says, laughing. “It just seemed like one of those wild propositions people make at 2:00 AM.”</P>
<P>But Russ would prove to be the ideal creative foil for Promises. As an indie rocker with a degree in jazz arranging, he helped enliven her signature, sophisticated accessibility with big electric-guitar riffs and punchy horn arrangements.</P>
<P>Promises was recorded live in communal congeniality in the Catskills at Old Soul Studios. Throughout the sessions, the studio band—which featured Russ’ Glass Elephant bandmates Danny Wolf, drums and Sam Petitti, guitar, along with bassist James Quinlan and guitarist/singer-songwriter Jon Paul—lived together and ate together with Russ as the chef. This atmosphere made an indelible imprint on the record. Tracks like “Promises” and “Wheels” have grace and grit. The latter tune’s gutbucket slide guitars curling around Natalie’s unique whiskey and honey vocals make it the optimum bridge between her past work and her current more muscular musicality.</P>
<P>Much of the album was written about romantic mis-steps and false-starts. The weary emotionality of it all is best expressed on the stunning “Lickety Split.” “That song is about the fantasy connections we concoct in our minds before we even know a person. Like when you think you can see a whole relationship play out before you’re even friends,’” Natalie says with a good-natured laugh.</P>
<P>Promises may seem like a brave step for Natalie, but it’s really a natural progression in her artistic evolution, and she will always cherish that album-making time she had in the Catskills because it allowed her to authentically further her creative continuum. “We recorded daily from noon to 10 PM,” she recalls. “After the sessions, we would all lay in front of a wood-burning stove and listen to Pink Floyd on vinyl. That’s my fondest memory. Everything just felt so right.”</P>

<H4>Antje Lang</H4>
<P>The first thing you should know about Antje is that her name is pronounced on-tee-yuh (she knows you were confused). As a newly signed artist to Small Town Records, Antje is excited to begin her musical career outside of her room. Largely a vocalist, Antje picked up a guitar two years ago, retaught herself piano four years ago, and enjoys messing around on random instruments like the mandolin and banjo. She considers herself a musician in the vein of the indie folk and folk rock genres, enjoying acoustic sounds and vocal harmonies. She credits a wide range of influences; from early childhood exposure to Gordon Lightfoot (thanks Mom) and Simon & Garfunkel (thanks Dad) to her own more current finds like The Head and the Heart, Alexi Murdoch, Gregory Alan Isakov, Benjamin Francis Leftwich, and an excessive amount of others that we won’t list here. Thanks for taking the time to read her bio and she sincerely hopes she will be playing for you in the near future.</P>

<P>TOBACCO can’t have nice things.</P>
<P>On his third album, the Pennsylvania snake-synth-charmer deepens his approach to aural depravity. Ultima II Massage widens a jagged swath through the dude’s own weird catalog, each disparate track damaged to the point of contributing to some sort of greater, lurching Frankenstein-like state. “I spent a lot of time breaking it in all the right places,” says TOBACCO. “It ends up making the whole thing breathe – sometimes gasp for air. It feels more alive.” Immediately after finishing 2010’s Maniac Meat, he went to work on the beat-addled series begun with Fucked Up Friends in 2008. There were notable breaks en route to now – a surprising commission to remix White Zombie’s “Thunder Kiss ‘65,” a new Black Moth Super Rainbow record (Cobra Juicy), and producing Demon Queen’s Exorcise Tape with vocalist Zackey Force Funk – but he saved the worst for last, amassing the most misanthropic material for Ultima. To wit, SPIN dubbed early share “Lipstick Destroyer” a “junkyard takedown of Daft Punk’s beloved, pristine electro.”</P>
<P>TOBACCO explains his modified approach: “I wanted to push each song just enough, so that even when the album’s at its wildest, it’s something you can zone out to. It feels like a definitive end to a concept I’ve been trying to perfect forever.Maniac Meat was linear. This time I wanted to do a lot of different things and have them come together as one meditative piece. At least for myself.”</P>
<P>Which, oddly enough, makes sense. This is easily TOBACCO’s most diverse set to date – his own Stereopathetic Soulmanure, but about that 1-900 hotline life: massage parlors, plasticized sleaze, fake tans, old dial-ups to the fan clubs of dead B-actors. Fittingly, the album’s only contributor is Beck music director Brian LeBarton who shrieks as Notrabel on the grimy freak-out “Streaker.” At 17 tracks,Ultima is stacked with beautifully perverse hits – from the sickly sticky “Eruption,” to the wobbly demon swaggerer “Face Breakout,” to the distorted punk spazz of “Dipsmack,” to the apocalyptic sepia ambience of “Spitlord.” You may hear disembodied bits of Boards of Canada, early Def Jam records, and Gary Numan, or maybe just public-access TV and bad VHS dubs of ‘80s horror flicks. Or the sun exploding and everything you’ve ever loved melting. Again, TOBACCO was just trying to make meditation music.</P>
<P>But to find that rotted sweet spot, as always, he had to subvert his pop urges. TOBACCO went back to the cassette decks he started off with – analog weapons of distortion to compliment his hissing vocoder and blown rhythms. Any moment that felt “just right” was brutally assaulted until ugly again. All to accomplish one end: “This might be my most purposely difficult album yet, but I promise if you let it in, it can fuck you up.”</P>
<P>Ultima II Massage. No happy ending.</P>

<P><EM><STRONG>T</STRONG></EM><STRONG>he Stargazer Lilies</STRONG> slow motion bathing through space music is like sun glistening on the water in sound, ambient rock for daydreamers to bob their heads to. The Northeastern Pennsylvania based trio of guitarist/bassist/drummer/producer, John Cep, singer/bassist, Kim Field, and live drummers EJ DeCoske and Johnny Lancia, bring back the raw rock primal gaze, no bullshit sunshine haze.</P>
<P> </P>
<P><EM><STRONG>T</STRONG></EM>he gazey dance floor where Soundpool, John & Kim’s previous band, dwelled lies behind them, while The Stargazer Lilies cosmic ambient arena lies ahead. Soundpool released three full-lengths in the last half decade, two on Aloft & Quince, and one on Killer Pimp. They shared the stage and in some cases toured with the likes of: Chapterhouse, Ulrich Schnauss, A Place to Bury Strangers, Asobi Seksu, School of Seven Bells, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Tobacco and Robin Guthrie to name a few.</P>
<P> </P>
<P><EM><STRONG>T</STRONG></EM>he Stargazer Lilies streamline and minimize Soundpool down to just the bare essentials, ridding themselves of the superfluous & getting down to the essence of what The Stargazer Lilies are: ~butterfly wings, slowly beating guitars enveloping the listener, ethereal breathy female vocals floating on a melody , rocked out bossa nova beats and bad ass bass throwing down the rhythm.<EM><STRONG></STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG></STRONG></EM>This new direction, like minimalism, gains strength by taking away and paring the instrumentation down to create vast vistas of sound.</P>

<p>It's time to start planning our meetings for 2014, and this will be the first planning meeting.  If you'd like to be involved in running the chapter, please consider joining us. If you'd like to be involved but can't make it this time, please email me or post to the OWASP Raleigh mailing list what aspect of the chapter you'd like to help out with.</p>
<p>For all members, please feel free to email me if you have suggestions for topics and speakers, or general ideas you'd like to propose for the chapter.</p>
<p>I'm fresh back from OWASP USA having spent a good deal of time in the chapter leader summit, and Jonathon Brenner as offered to get us a consistent meeting location at Cisco, so we have ideas and resources we need to kickstart this chapter.  We'd love if you'd like to help us make it a success!</p>

1234,Brief Histories of Design,"<p>Remember history class where everyone had to write a paper on a person from a particular time period? Well, imagine that, but focusing on designers, presented somewhat like a Lightning Talk. ""Design"" is a broad subject, and could pertain to a lot of things. Architecture, CSS, Manufacturing, Print, City planning, Pencils! Try listening to a few episodes of 99% Invisible to get warmed up, then hit the library to learn more about who designed your favorite things!</p> <p><br/>Suggested Topics . . .</p> <p>WWW<br/>The World Wide Web has done a particularly poor job of keeping track of its historical moments. Many are locked away in peoples' memories. You could focus on the life of a particular designer through their blogs, archive.org, and really just by Surfing The Web — your favorite thing to do anyway.</p> <p><a href=""https://archive.org/web/""><a href=""https://archive.org/web/"" class=""linkified"">https://archive.org/web/</a></a> might be useful.</p> <p><br/>Print<br/>Gutenberg wasn't the only important person in print history. Not even close! Who invented CMYK? Who invented silkscreens? Who invented PostScript .. and why would they do such a thing? I don't know the answers to these questions, but about 15 minutes from you might, and then you can tell everyone about it!</p> <p>Computer Graphics<br/>A long trail of computer graphics history awaits your discovery in the forms of whitepapers written by huddles of PhDs at MIT and Utah. (my personal favorite) If you're stuck finding juicy WWW or Print material, there's plenty to talk about in the world of CG.

The first and most popular cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which will likely be the dominant cryptocurrency being traded at each meetup (though all cryptocurrencies are welcome). Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>Ground rules:<br/>1. No force.<br/>2. No fraud.<br/>3. No coercion.<br/>4. Have fun!</p> <p>We meet right in the middle of Nash Square, next to the Fallen Fire Fighters Memorial.  During the winter, when it is cold and dark, we may wander over to the Brewmasters reasturant rather quickly.  Brewmasters across the street from the south west corner of Nash Square.</p>",2014-03-13,2014-03-11 09:00:33.98189,2014-03-11 09:00:33.98189,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Bitcoin-Meetup/events/170066372/,Triangle Bitcoin Meetup,,

<b>This is a completely open, free-form, ""just show up with a laptop (or a friend with a laptop) and hack on some Cocoa"" meeting.

895,Intro to scikit-learn (Machine Learning in Python) with Tim Hopper,"<p>Hi Triangle useRs,</p> <p>There has been a lively debate recently on whether Python is poised to supplant R as the preferred tool for data scientists.  David Smith sums it up well at <a href=""http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/12/r-and-python.html""><a href=""http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/12/r-and-python.html"" class=""linkified"">http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/12/r-and-python.html</a></a>. (TL;DR: R is not going anywhere; there is room for both R and Python; some data suggests that usage of R is actually growing faster.)</p> <p>This Thursday we have an opportunity to learn more about how Python can be used for data work.  Tim Hopper will present Scikit-learn, a Python package providing an implementation of many machine learning algorithms that R can also do (e.g. SVM, kNN, linear models, HMM, k-means, spectral clustering).</p> <p>Description from Tim: ""The benefits of Scikit-learn goes well beyond carefully implemented learning algorithms. Being built in Python, it allows easy integration with countless other Python modules for tasks such as plotting, data munging, and application development. Its consistent API across algorithms allows for rapid experimentation with multiple learning methods. Also, Scikit-learn is well documented and provides lots of examples.  Instead of discussing particular machine learning algorithms provided by the package, I will focus on Scikit-learn and Python as a toolkit for solving data problems from start to finish. I will emphasize the Pipeline tool which allows the user to chain together all the steps of a machine learning pipeline including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, and model fitting.""</p> <p>I look forward to seeing you this Thursday for this event, at the Cameron Village Regional Library in Raleigh.</p> <p>Thanks,<br/>Ian</p>",2014-01-16,2014-01-14 09:00:59.454199,2014-01-14 09:00:59.454199,http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-useR/events/160320832/,Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill R Users Group,,

<p>No prior experience is required to attend hack afternoon and you don't even need to own an Arduino. There are plenty of members who will be glad to let you look over their shoulder and ask questions. Some will even hand you some parts and let you tinker. If you have your own parts, definitely bring them. We have lots of space and everyone should have room to work on a reasonably sized project.</p>
<p>You don't need to be a member of SplatSpace in order to attend, but please do ask about the membership options while you're there. It's a great group of folks and, if you're into embedded computing there's a good chance that you'll share interests with other attendees.</p>

696,Triangle SQL Server User Group Meeting,"<p>Squeezing Top Performance from Your Virtualized SQL Server</p>
<p>Just about anyone can click through a SQL Server installation and get it working, but more than a little tuning is required to get the most performance out of your servers. When your servers are virtualized, additional tuning can help get even more performance out of that virtual machine.</p>
<p>This session will cover valuable details for both VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V on how to tweak and tune your virtual infrastructure for business-critical virtualized SQL Servers. You’ll learn tips for configuring your SQL Server installations for maximum performance when virtualized and for monitoring and capacity management so that you know when you need to add more hardware to keep your database servers running at peak performance.</p>

Even if you've never heard of or used cryptocurrencies, bring a smartphone or laptop, a good attitude and good questions, and be prepared to have your mind blown by the possibilities which are unlocked by cryptocurrencies.</p>

 1. No force. <br />

 2. No fraud. <br />

 3. No coercion. <br />

938,Continuous Deployment and Automated ATDD,"<p>Today’s QA organizations often have sizable investments in test automation. Unfortunately running and maintaining your test suites represents a sizable investment. Far too often this hard work is abandoned and teams revert to a more costly, but familiar, manual approach.</p> <p><br/>A more practical solution is to integrate your test automation suites with a concept called “continuous integration”. A CI system monitors your source code and compiles the system after every change. Once the build is complete, test suites are automatically run. This approach of ongoing test execution provides your developers rapid feedback and keeps your tests in constant use. It also frees your testers up for more involved exploratory testing.</p> <p>Jared shows how to set up an open source continuous integration tool and explains the best way for you to introduce this technique to your developers and testers. The concepts are simple when presented properly and provide solid benefits to all areas of an organization.</p> <p>

780,TriPython December 2013 Meeting: The Clean Architecture in Python,"<p><a href=""http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/"">Brandon Rhodes</a>, PSF member, author of <a href=""http://www.apress.com/9781430230038"">Foundations of Python Network Programming Second Edition</a> and the <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyephem"">pyephem</a> scientific-grade astronomy module, and a <a href=""http://pyvideo.org/search?models=videos.video&amp;q=rhodes"">frequent favorite presenter</a> at Python conferences worldwide, will present ""The Clean Architecture in Python."" Brandon describes the talk as, ""Python programmers already use many design patterns in their work. Each pattern distills the wisdom the community has learned over the years, often at great expense, and makes it available to younger programmers. But even design-conscious programmers often find their applications growing more difficult to test and expand. In this talk, we will learn about how the recently propounded 'Clean Architecture' applies to Python applications, and how this high-level design pattern fits particularly well with the features of the Python language and addresses questions that experienced programmers have been asking at the last few PyCons.""</p>
<p>Lightning talks, 5 to 10 minutes extemporaneous expositions on a topic of interest to you, something you recently learned, kind of like a show and tell, are always welcome as well. Please see the <a href=""http://bullcitycoworking.com/location/"">parking</a> instructions on the BCC website. A wide variety of possibilities for the after-meeting are within steps of BCC.</p>

781,Dirty Santa/White Elephant Party,"<p>If you aren't familiar with White Elephant/Dirty Santa parties you basically go and get some outlandish, useless, and ridiculous gift and we stack them all in a pile. Then we take turns picking a gift and stealing gifts from each-other. I will explain the rules in more depth at the party but it is a lot of fun!</p>
<p><b><i>So everyone needs to bring 1 wrapped gift!!!</i></b></p>
<p>I would encourage you not to spend more than $20 on a gift. Generally they will cost $10 or less and could be something you already have.</p>
<p>We will also have hot coco and snackage (probably christmas cookies). Feel free to bring some snackage!</p>

782,WordPress: Performance Tuning Crash Course,"<p>This month's WordPress Chapel Hill Meetup will focus on performance tuning. Page speed ( the speed that a page loads in the browser) has been added to Google's search algorithm. Optimizing your site to load as fast as possible can help your search ranking and its also good for your users, because Google researched page speed from around the web and found that the slower your site, the more likely you are to lose visitors. It makes absolute sense, because no one likes to wait for a slow site and they'll jump somewhere else to get the information they need as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Here are two links that might be useful to review.</p>
<p>From feedthebot, a landing page full of specific things you need to do as a developer or a marketing department needs to direct their developers to do, if they aren't optimizing your WordPress site to load as fast as possible.</p>

993,Main Meeting: Going realtime w/ SignalR - Derik Whittaker,"<p><b>Going realtime w/ SignalR</b></p> <p>One of the historical issues w/ HTML applications is the its lack of a stateful connection between the client and the server.  In the past it was very common to solve this problem by either running a timer loop in javascript and make some sort of remote call to check for changes, or worse yet by refreshing the active page on a regular interval.</p> <p>With the adoption of HTML 5 and WebSockets it is now possible to get near real time communication between the server and client in a much more elegant way.  In this session we will explore what problems SignalR solves and how to solve them.  By the end our journey you will know how you can utilize SignalR to build a real time quiz application to communicate between your server and browser based applications.</p> <p><b>Derik Whittaker</b> is a Software Architect who specializes in all things .Net. Derik has been building enterprise systems on top of the .Net technology stack for over 14 years and along the way has picked up a thing or two about how to create enterprise scale software systems.</p> <p>During his 14 year career Derik has worked in many different industries ranging from Marking, Healthcare, Retail, Insurance, Automotive and Online Entertainment. Currently Derik is working for a Technology startup (orgspan.com) in Durham North Carolina leading their windows phone and windows modern UI application development. Derik believes that the job of a developer is more than just turning syntax into working 1’s and 0’s. He believes that our job is to produce a system which gets out of the users way and allows them to do their job better. </p> <p>Derik has been awarded the Microsoft MVP in C# for the past 6 years. Along with being an MVP he is also a member of the ASPInsiders group. Derik is also a Pluralsight Author with multiple course under his belt. He is a community leader, helping to organize events such as Chicago Codeapalooza, Chicago Code Camp and the Raleigh Code Camp. </p> <p>Outside of his day job you can find Derik hanging out with his beautiful wife Tiffany and his 2 awesome boys Brendan and Ryan.</p> <p><b>Meeting Agenda:</b> </p> <p>5:30-6:00 - Welcome/Food <br/>6:00-6:15 - Announcements <br/><b>6:15-7:45 - Presentation</b> <br/>7:45-8:00 - Give-aways</p> <p><b>Thank you to February's Main Meeting sponsor!</b></p> <p><img src=""http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/2/1/a/600_323077402.jpeg"" /></p>",2014-02-12,2014-02-05 09:06:09.094827,2014-02-05 09:06:09.094827,http://www.meetup.com/TRINUG/events/156750262/,Triangle .NET User Group,,

If you would like to <span>speak or moderate a group discussion, come brainstorm about it.  Otherwise, we'll be talking about whatever has our attention.</span></p>
<p><span> <br />

</span></p>
<p>Open floor discussion, open topics. Some tickler topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book reviews -- what new books have you read (or written!)</li>
<li>""Keeping Up w/ the Joneses,"" or, your new computer toys</li>
<li>Keeping Up Yourself, or, what new software/services have you learned (or written!)</li>

<p>New sponsors are coming on too. I hope to have them listed by the time the meeting rolls around!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Note About Meeting Times</strong></p>
<p>Since many of us get to the meeting early, we will make a half-hour available as a meet-eat-and-greet time prior to any presentations or shop talk. We will continue to start formally at 7:30pm, but the time change is to reflect this chatting time.</p>
<p>Since we all usually chat as people arrive, we will not continue to do a round-robin greeting at 7:30pm. We will instead end the greeting period with announcements, and then give the floor to the presenter or moderator.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Please consider the benefits of moderating, presenting lecture style, or giving a tutorial:</p>

<li>Increased Good Will</li>

1167,Matt Phillips and the Philharmonic,"<DIV>
<H4>Matt Phillips and the Philharmonic</H4>
</DIV>
<DIV>
<P>Matt Phillips & the Philharmonic is a soulful band that strives to make music people can get behind. After aging out of his high-school band, Cole Park, Matt Phillips continued his solo career into college at ECU. With folk and soul roots as deep as the cracks in his weathered acoustic, Matt has crafted his songwriting skills working alongside Django Haskins (International Orange, The Old Ceremony) and began pumping out songs known for their emotionality and loveable lyrics. After scoring an internship at Manifold Recording near his home in Chapel Hill, NC, Matt recorded his first EP with Manifold’s chief engineer, Ian Schreier.</P>
<P>Joining forces in the Fall 2011 with four other tall, handsome gentlemen from East Carolina University’s School of Music, Matt and the guys (Travis Huff, Connor Mangold, Greg Williams and Tre Harrison) have come together as Matt Phillips & The Philharmonic. The five-member, instrumentally flexible band lays out a sly-jazzy feel with soulful vocals and big-band era horn solos. Add that to the thump of feel-good baselines, tight drums, and the occasional harmonica solo, and you can’t help but bob your head. The band is currently raising money to record their first full-length album to be released in summer 2013.</P>
<P>With nearly 300 shows already under their belt and a solid EP paving their way, Matt Phillips & the Philharmonic combines stellar songwriting, soulful vocals, and a full ensemble of musicians into a unique band with a very bright future.</P>

<H4>Cairo Fire</H4>
</DIV>
<P>Looking for a vintage Cure Record? Dying to get your hands on a print of Robert Knight’s first Hendrix image? Or even just a place to crash because you sold away your worldly possessions to travel cross-country in the hopes of being “great”. Whatever the intent, for over a decade, most have taken to craigslist to find what they were looking for. The boys of Cairo Fire took to craigslist and by an odd twist of fate, found each other.</P>
<P>Will White was living his days as a freelance fashion designer. Most of his nights, though, were filled with music, which led to his ascension through a sea of hopefuls to the top 28 boys of American Idol’s Season 12. Upon his exit, the would-be front man released his first self –penned and produced solo effort but was left in dyer need of a “next step”. Simultaneously, twin brothers and producer-musicians, Michael and Joseph Pepe were in need of the same in Charlotte, NC. Having parted ways with their band which had recently toured the nation and been dubbed by Billboard magazine as one of the “top 8 unsigned acts in the country”, the brothers needed a fresh start with even fresher ideas. This was when they came across a post White had written looking for just that.</P>
<P>Within a few short months, the trio realized that they had truly found something special in their union. Complete with over a dozen original songs, the best were chosen for a 5 track EP to be produced by Patrick Boyd (The Paper Tongues, The Noises 10, Slowrunner). Set for an early 2014 release the record will be followed by its own extensive set of tour dates. The sound of Cairo Fire is the summation of White’s smoky soaring power vocal, M. Pepe’s effortless pop/rock chord progressions and time signature, and J.Pepe’s chunky melodic bass lines all fused with strong hints of electronica. Each of these can be heard in “Bold & Beautiful” the band’s first single release and collective “next step”.</P>

<H4>Apples and Airplanes</H4>
<P>In 2010, guitar player Jade Werth and saxophonist Jack Johnson met at an open mic night in Raleigh, NC where they formed the band, “Apples and Airplanes.” With the acquisition of bassist Matt Voos, trumpeter Daniel Grooms, lead guitarist Aaron Ordy, and drummer Nate Brisson, what started as a duo soon grew to become a six-piece, high-energy, multi-instrumental band. The band has played locally at various venues: Southland Ballroom, The Pour House Music Hall, Deep South The Bar, Southland Ball Room, Pantana Bobs, Exile on Main Street, among others.</P>
<P>Since 2011, Apples and Airplanes has been the official North Carolina State Wolfpack tailgate band, performing in the parking lot at each of the season’s home games. In addition, they have been honored to open for notable national acts “311” and “Sublime with Rome” at Time-Warner Cable Pavilion in Raleigh. Once established, Apples and Airplanes were granted the opportunity to venture north, and perform as the opening act for ""Rusted Root"" in Pittsburgh, PA.</P>
<P>Each member comes from a very different walk of life and musical background to make a sound that is unique and true to it's own.</P>

1248,QS Show & Tell - Topics TBA,"<p>In the tradition of QS show and tells, this meeting will be structured as follows</p> <p>6:30 - 7:00PM - free socializing time</p> <p>7:00 - 8:00PM - quick presentations on people's ongoing projects.</p> <p>Presentations should take a maximum of ten minutes and should answer three principal questions: What did you do? How did you do it? What did you learn? A good rule of thumb is to cover include 6-8 slides. Please send the slides/topics to me in advance in and I will add your information and topic of discussion to the meetup description so that other people can come to hear you speak. You can alert me to your interests in presenting in your event RSVP or via email jason.t.james at gmail dot com.</p> <p>If you've never been to a QS meetup before, you can get a sense of what the talks are like from watching <a href=""http://vimeo.com/groups/quantifiedself/videos"">videos of previous QS talks</a>.

1250,Lightning Talks: Histories of Design,"<p>Remember history class where everyone had to write a paper on a person from a particular time period? Well, imagine that, but focusing on designers, presented somewhat like a Lightning Talk. ""Design"" is a broad subject, and could pertain to a lot of things. Architecture, CSS, Manufacturing, Print, City planning, Pencils! Try listening to a few episodes of 99% Invisible to get warmed up, then hit the library to learn more about who designed your favorite things!</p> <p><br/>Suggested Topics . . .</p> <p>WWW<br/>The World Wide Web has done a particularly poor job of keeping track of its historical moments. Many are locked away in peoples' memories. You could focus on the life of a particular designer through their blogs, archive.org, and really just by Surfing The Web — your favorite thing to do anyway.</p> <p><a href=""https://archive.org/web/""><a href=""https://archive.org/web/"" class=""linkified"">https://archive.org/web/</a></a> might be useful.</p> <p><br/>Print<br/>Gutenberg wasn't the only important person in print history. Not even close! Who invented CMYK? Who invented silkscreens? Who invented PostScript .. and why would they do such a thing? I don't know the answers to these questions, but about 15 minutes from you might, and then you can tell everyone about it!</p> <p>Computer Graphics<br/>A long trail of computer graphics history awaits your discovery in the forms of whitepapers written by huddles of PhDs at MIT and Utah. (my personal favorite) If you're stuck finding juicy WWW or Print material, there's plenty to talk about in the world of CG.
